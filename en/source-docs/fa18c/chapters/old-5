HORNET MASTER MODES
The Hornet has three master modes of operation: Navigation (NAV), Air-to-Air (A/A), and Air-to-
Ground (A/G). The displays and avionics equipment operations are tailored as a function of the
selected master mode. A/A master mode is entered by either pressing the A/A master mode button
or by selecting an A/A weapon with the Weapon Select Switch. When A/A is selected, the radar
display is placed on the right DDI, and the Stores Management System (SMS) display is placed on the
left DDI. A/G master mode is selected by pressing the A/G master mode button. When neither master
button is enabled (neither button lit), the Hornet is in the NAV master mode.
Before using the Hornet navigation system, enable the system by placing the INS knob on the Sensor
Panel to the NAV position. [RIGHT CONSOLE]
