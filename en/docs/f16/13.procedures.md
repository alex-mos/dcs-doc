15. Ejection safety lever Arm (down)
Keyboard Command: N/A
This arms the ejection seat and allows ejection when the ejection handle is
pulled. This is delayed for as long as possible to prevent inadvertent
ejection on the ground. Egress through other means is usually preferable.
TAKEOFF
Once lined up for takeoff on the directed runway, you may perform a final run-up check:

1. Brakes Hold
Keyboard Command: N/A




2. Parking Brake Verify disengaged
Keyboard Command: N/A




3. Throttle 90% RPM
Keyboard Command: N/A
Check for normal engine indications:
- HYD/OIL PRESS warning light – Off
- OIL pressure – 25-65 psi (must increase as RPM increases)
- FTIT – 935⁰ C or less
- HYD PRESS A & B – 2850-3250 psi


4. Brakes Released
Keyboard Command: N/A
5. Throttle Advance to desired thrust
Keyboard Command: N/A

roll. Check for normal acceleration and normal engine indications.




6. NWS Disengage at 70 Knots
Keyboard Command: N/A




Gently pull back on the stick and establish takeoff attitude (8–12°) at approximately 10 knots below takeoff
speed for MIL power or 15 knots below takeoff speed for AB.
Acft Weight (lbs) 20,000 24,000 28,000 32,000 36,000 40,000 44,000

TO Speed (KIAS) 128 142 156 168 178 188 198


Low stick forces are needed for rotation. Pulling back on the stick early may lead to uncontrollability due to early
lift-off at low speed and increase the distance needed to take off.
Ensure a positive rate of climb is established and raise the landing gear. The trailing edge flaps retract at the
same time as the landing gear and may cause the aircraft to settle and scrape the runway when lift is lost.
The landing gear should be up and locked before exceeding 300 knots. Higher airspeeds may detach wiring
and other components or cause structural damage to the landing gear doors.


Crosswind Takeoff
When taking off in a crosswind, the aircraft will want to weather-vane into the wind (turn into the wind). This will
have the result of raising the upwind wing. To counteract, you want to use a slight amount of left or right stick
into the wind direction. This will help keeping the wing level. You will also want to use a little rudder input to
keep a straight takeoff roll down the center of the runway.
During rotation, be careful to smoothly blend rudder input to establish a proper crab angle into the wind. With a
proper crab angle, the Flight Path Marker (FPM) should be aligned down the runway when becoming airborne.
NORMAL FLIGHT
There are no specific procedures to follow once airborne. You will need to rely on your own understanding of
aircraft systems and basic flight to keep the aircraft in one piece and accomplish the mission.


In-Flight Checks
At frequent intervals, check the aircraft systems, engine instruments, cockpit pressure, and oxygen flow
indicator and system operation. Monitor fuel in each internal and external tank to verify that fuel is transferring
properly by rotating the FUEL QTY SEL knob and checking that the sum of the pointers and totalizer agree, and
that fuel distribution is correct.


Trimming the Aircraft
The Flight Control System does a great job of maintaining aircraft trim but there are some situations where you
will need to manually trim the aircraft. When out of trim, you will notice the aircraft wanting to pitch, roll or yaw
(roll being the most common).
The trim switch is used to move the control stick to a new “neutral “position. For example: if the nose wants to
raise, you can input some nose down trim that will move the neutral point forward to a new position. This
relieves you from maintaining continuous pressure on the stick to maintain level flight when out of trim.


Trim Switch




The most common need for trim is when stores are released that cause an asymmetric configuration. For
example, releasing a bomb from a left wing station but not the right will cause a roll to the right, in the direction
of the heavier wing. Roll trim will be required for the aircraft to maintain wings level flight with no stick input.
AIR REFUELING
Some missions may require air refueling to ensure you have enough fuel to reach the target and return safely to
base. Even if more fuel is not required, you may wish to top off your tanks to allow more options in the target
area, like a low altitude, high speed ingress or more liberal use of the afterburner.
Tanker locations will be noted in the mission briefing or displayed on the Mission Planner screen. Tankers are
also equipped with air-to-air TACAN to help with the rendezvous. If in doubt, you may also request a vector to
the nearest tanker from AWACS.




You should announce your intent to refuel before approaching the tanker using the communications menu.




The tanker will respond with their current altitude and airspeed and clear you to the pre-contact position.
Continue to fly the rendezvous using radar or TACAN as a guide.
The following steps should be taken to make your aircraft safe before approaching the tanker.

1. MASTER ARM Switch OFF
Keyboard Command: N/A
2. LASER ARM Switch OFF
Keyboard Command: N/A




3. Emitters OFF/STBY
Keyboard Command: N/A
Radiation from emitters like ECM, Radar or Radar Altimeter may present
a hazard to tanker aircraft and personnel. Use them during the
rendezvous if required but turn them off prior to reaching the pre-contact
position.
This can be done using the individual panels for each system or with the
RF Switch. When set to SILENT, all radiation from the aircraft is disabled,
to include the radar, radar altimeter, data link, TACAN transmit, and ECM.
In QUIET mode though, the radar, TACAN, and data link transmit but all
other emissions are inhibited.



Take the following steps to configure the aircraft for refueling.

4. AIR REFUEL Switch Open
Keyboard Command: N/A
This should be done 3-5 minutes prior to refueling with external fuel
tanks to depressurize the tanks and allow them to be filled.

8. DED Bingo Page Monitor
Keyboard Command: N/A
As a technique, you may choose to pull the Bingo page up on the DED
by selecting LIST→2 on the ICP. Your total fuel load will be displayed.
This allows you to verify you are tasking fuel without going heads-down
to the fuel quantity indicator.




Take the pre-contact position directly behind the boom and report you are ready to refuel.
The boomer will clear you to the contact position. Use small, smooth control inputs, and add a very slight
amount of throttle. Be patient and allow that power change to move you forward.
Allow the boom to pass just left or right of your canopy, about 2-3 feet above your head. This serves as a good
first check that you are at the proper height relative to the tanker. Continue to move slowly forward, maintaining
alignment with the yellow stripe painted on the bottom of the tanker.
Fly formation on the tanker and allow the boom operator to fly the boom into the refueling receptacle behind the
cockpit on your aircraft. Use the director lights on the bottom of the tanker to maintain a position within the limits
of the boom.

Centerline Stripe



D - Down F - Forward



A - Aft
U - Up




The lights are directive, meaning they tell you the direction to travel and not your current position. In other
words, preface the D, U, F and A with the word “go”. If the light moves toward the D, go down; if it moves
toward the U, go up. If the light moves toward the A, go aft; if it moves toward the F, go forward.
The boomer will announce ‘contact’ and ‘you are taking fuel’ when the connection is established. The AR/NWS
light next to the HUD will illuminate. Monitor your fuel transfer on the DED or Fuel Quantity indicator.
It is likely you will unintentionally disconnect at some point in the process, especially on your first few attempts.
If this happens, return to the pre-contact position, and try again.

1. Initial Approach. Align your aircraft with the landing runway at 1,500 feet above ground level (AGL) and
300 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS).
2. Overhead Break. Break left or right over the desired touchdown point, set throttle to about 80% RPM, and
open the speedbrakes. Fly the break at about 70 deg of bank and 3-4 G. Align the HUD Flight Path Marker
with the Horizon Line to maintain a level turn.
3. Downwind Leg. Roll out on the downwind leg opposite the landing heading at about 200-220 KCAS and
1,500 feet AGL. Extend the landing gear and confirm three green gear down indications. Reduce speed as
required to prevent excessive airspeed buildup in the base turn and trim to an angle of attack (AoA) of 11°.
4. Base Turn. Initiate the base turn when abeam the rollout point. You may estimate this position by starting
the turn when your wingtip is at the end of the runway when viewed from the cockpit. Lower the nose to 8–
10° and fly the turn at 11° AoA.
5. Final Turn. Use your throttle to control airspeed while using the stick maintain 8–10° nose low and 11°
AoA through the turn. Roll out on final and raise the nose to maintain proper glide path. The goal is to roll
out in line with the runway at approximately 300 feet AGL one mile from the touchdown point. Align the
HUD flight path marker and 2.5° pitch ladder with the runway threshold to ensure proper glidepath while
maintaining 11° AoA.
6. Short Final. When over the overrun, the portion of the runway before the primary surface starts, shift the
flight path marker forward to a point 300-500 down the runway. Gently pull back on the stick to flare and
reduce the descent rate but do not level off. Pull the throttle back to idle and touchdown with a maximum
AoA of 13°. More than 15° during the landing roll-out may cause the speedbrakes or engine nozzle to
contact the runway so use gentle stick inputs to avoid overcontrolling the aircraft.
7. Roll-Out. Maintain 13° nose-up attitude for two-point aerodynamic braking until your airspeed has reduced
to approximately 100 knots. Reduce back stick pressure and lower the nosewheel to the runway. Open the
speedbrakes fully and maintain full aft stick for maximum braking effectiveness.
Apply moderate to heavy braking to slow the aircraft. Engage nosewheel steering when below 30 knots
unless it is required earlier to prevent departure from the runway.


Crosswind Landing
When landing in a crosswind, you should maintain wings-level and allow the aircraft to crab through touchdown.
At touchdown, quickly correct with rudder to maintain alignment down the runway. After touchdown, the aircraft
will want to weathervane into the wind, so you must compensate with rudder use or differential braking. A small
amount of left or right stick into the wind direction may be required to help keep the wings level.
Perform the landing roll-out as described above but maintain two-point aerobraking until below 100 knots or
aircraft control becomes a problem.
High rudder pedal force may cause an abrupt yaw as nosewheel steering is engaged. Center the rudder before
engaging nosewheel steering if possible.
AFTER LANDING
When the aircraft is safely back on the ground it is time to start powering down systems and preparing for
shutdown. These tasks may be performed as you taxi clear of the runway. You may also pull into an arm/de-
arm area to complete the tasks if desired.

Combined Radar Mode (CRM). This mode combines air-to-air sub-modes used for search under one interface.
Sub-modes are:
- Range While Search (RWS)
- Track While Scan (TWS)
Air Combat Mode (ACM). This mode combines all sub-modes for automatic target acquisition under one
interface. Sub-modes are:
- 30° × 20°
- Boresight
- 10° × 60°
- Slewable
Single Target Track (STT) is an additional mode entered by locking a target in CRM or ACM sub-modes.
Air-to-Air weapon employment using the radar is discussed in the following sections:
Air to Air Gunnery
AIM-9M/X Employment
AIM-120 Employment
We will first discuss aspects of the radar that spans multiple modes, and then later we will discuss radar
functions specific to unique applications/weapons.
The air-to-air radar display uses a standard B-scope format in which the ownship (your aircraft) is in the bottom
center of the display. As such, all indications on the b-scope are ahead of the ownship. Targets on the scope
are displayed in range from the closest being at the bottom and the more distant being toward the top. Contacts
left and right of the ownship are represented as being indicted left and right of the center of the display to
indicate azimuth.

Important, basic components of the display include:
Radar Display Range. The currently selected range displayed on the MFD is shown on the left of the display.
This can be increased or decreased by pressing the adjacent OSBs or by slewing the acquisition cursor to the
top or bottom of the display.
Target Symbols. Target symbols are displayed as solid squares (bricks). The horizonal position of the target
symbol indicates angular position in respect to ownship heading. The vertical position indicates range.
Acquisition Cursor. Consisting of two parallel, vertical lines, this cursor is moved in response to Cursor/Enable
Switch commands. When in a RADAR search mode, the altitude band being covered by the RADAR beam is
indicated above and below the cursor.
Targets are locked by slewing the cursor over the target symbol and commanding TMS Up on your stick.
Range Scale. The right side of the b-scope represents RADAR range. The scale includes marks for ¼, ½, and
¾ of the selected radar range.
Azimuth Setting. Indicates the azimuth setting, in tens of degrees. A setting of “A6” means the radar is
scanning 60° to either side of boresight, which is the maximum scan azimuth. Options are A6, A3, and A1.
Azimuth setting will be A1 during the RWS acquisition process. Higher azimuth settings will result in a longer
detection period and a slower refresh rate.
Elevation Setting. Indicates the elevation area scanned, in number of bars. A setting of “4B” means the radar
is sweeping four different elevations (corresponding to a 40° elevation range). Options are 4B, 2B, and 1B.
Higher elevation settings will result in a longer detection period and a slower refresh rate.
Antenna Azimuth and Elevation Caret. The current radar azimuth is shown by a T symbol on the bottom of
the display. The current radar elevation is shown by a T symbol on the left of the display. The carats move
along scales that show the full ±60⁰ sweep range of the antenna.
Ownship Bearing and Range. This shows the bearing and range from your own aircraft to the Bullseye.
Control Menu. Pressing this OSB takes you to the control menu. See Control (CNTL) .
Radar modes are selected by pressing the OSB adjacent to the current mode (OSB1). After pressing this OSB,
a menu of all available air-to-air modes is displayed on the left side of the display. Press the OSB adjacent to
the desired mode to select it.


Radar Mode




Mode Selections




Combined Radar Mode (CRM)
This mode is selected by default at power-up. It is designed to reduce pilot workload by combining air-to-air
sub-modes used for search under one interface. Sub-modes are:
- Range While Search (RWS)
o Situational Awareness Mode (SAM)
o Dual Target Track (DTT)
- Track While Scan (TWS)
- Single Target Track (STT)
The RWS and TWS sub-modes may be cycled by pressing OSB 2 adjacent to the sub-mode.

You can also cycle between RWS and TWS by holding TMS right for more than one second.

Range While Search (RWS) Sub-mode
The Range While Search (RWS) sub-mode is used for fast, long-range acquisition and engagement. The pilot
can set the acquisition range (10, 20, 40, 80, or 160 nautical miles) and change the azimuth width and
elevation.
Targets may be acquired and tracked in three ways: Situational Awareness Mode (SAM), Dual Target Track
(DTT), or Single Target Track (STT).
• Situational Awareness Mode (SAM). Placing the acquisition cursor over a target and pressing TMS
forward commands SAM. The antenna will be directed to the cursor position and a 4-bar, ±10° spotlight
scan will be performed while TMS forward is held.
Acquisition Cursor
Target



Spotlight Scan




If a target is not under the acquisition cursor when TMS forward is released or no target is detected, the
scan coverage reverts to the previous scan pattern. The SAM acquisition sequence will only commence if
a target was under the TDC when TMS forward was pressed.
After a successful acquisition, the radar enters SAM mode, with the target bugged. The radar will continue
a scan pattern, pausing to dwell on the bugged target periodically. An AIM-120 AMRAAM will guide on the
bugged target even without an STT lock.




Additional Target

DLZ
Bugged Target


Scan Limit Lines




If a missile is selected (AIM-9 or AIM-120), the DLZ will be displayed along the right edge.
SAM mode may be exited with TMS aft. Positioning the acquisition cursor over the bugged target and
pressing TMS forward commands Single Target Track. Positioning the acquisition cursor over another
target and pressing TMS forward commands Dual Target Track.
• Dual Target Track (DTT). Dual Target Track is entered from SAM by bugging a second target. In DTT
mode, the radar will dwell on two targets while continuing a scan pattern centered around the secondary
target. If the primary target closes within 10 NM of the aircraft, the scan pattern is inhibited, and the radar
will “ping-pong” between the two bugged targets.




Primary Target
Additional Target


Secondary
Target




In DTT, pressing TMS left will swap the primary and secondary targets. The radar will shift its scan pattern
to be centered around the new secondary target. AIM-120 launches in DTT will track the primary target.
• Single Target Track (STT). Placing the acquisition cursor over a primary bugged target and pressing TMS
forward commands Single Target Track mode. Placing the acquisition target over a non-bugged target and
pressing TMS up twice in quick succession accomplishes the same function.
In STT, the radar focuses all its energy on a single target and provides high-resolution and high-frequency
updates. However, the radar does not scan, and will no longer detect other contacts. If the enemy has a
RWR onboard, it will be alerted to the STT lock.

STT mode may be exited with TMS aft. TMS Aft once returns to SAM mode with the target bugged. TMS
Aft twice returns to the previous CRM mode.
This mode is discussed in the Single Target Track (STT) section below.


Track While Scan (TWS) Sub-mode
TWS mode is a multi-target tracking mode. In TWS, the radar will initially detect only hits, like RWS. However,
as successive hits in proximity are detected in subsequent scans, the radar will attempt to combine these hits
into targets. Each detected target is represented by a trackfile, which stores a history of detected hits. This
history is used to build a picture of the target’s heading, speed, and other properties.
TWS has several restrictions. The radar will attempt to build trackfiles for each contact, but given a large scan
volume, there will be a sizable refresh time between scans. During each scan the radar will try to predict the
position of the contact for the next scan. If, however, the target takes evasive, high-G maneuvers and quickly
changing its trajectory and speed, the radar can lose the track by making an incorrect trackfile prediction, and
the contact will disappear from the radar, replaced only with a hit on the next scan.
TWS, when combined with the AIM-120, provides a powerful ability to engage multiple targets quickly.
Nevertheless, target tracking is not as reliable as SAM, and especially less reliable than STT. Unlike STT
though, a TWS lock does not trigger an elevated RWR indication. As such, the first warning the enemy pilot will
likely get is when the radar seeker of the AIM-120 goes active.
Trackfiles are automatically established on up to 10 targets based on information received from each radar
sweep. The radar scan volume options are identical to those used for RWS but are reduced to 3-bar, ±25° when
a target is designated.
Four types of target symbols are available to help sort contacts. They are, in increasing order of importance:
Search Target, Track Target, System Target, and Bugged Target. In addition, two other target symbols can
appear: Cursor Target and Locked Target.
Search Target. These are radar hits that have not been resolved well enough to build a track. They are
displayed as a small brick in much the same way as in RWS.
These targets disappear after a few sweeps if a track cannot be obtained. If a valid track is obtained, usually
after being detected on two consecutive sweeps, the contact automatically becomes a Track Target.
Track Target. Once enough information about a Search Target has been received to build a trackfile, it is
upgraded to a Track Target. These targets are displayed as a larger brick with a velocity vector line showing
their direction of travel. Their altitude is displayed just below each contact. Up to 10 of these tracks may be
present at one time.




Track Target
Search Targets




Track targets can be considered the most basic radar contact. Other options become available after a trackfile
has been established. The pilot can upgrade any Track Targets of interest to System Targets.
System Target. System Targets are Track Targets designated by the pilot. System Targets are not given any
additional radar energy; the System Target feature is only used by the pilot to designate those targets that the
pilot may wish to monitor or employ weapons against later.
To upgrade a Track Target to a System Target, position the radar cursor over a Track Target and press TMS
Forward. If no System Targets have yet been designated, pressing TMS Right upgrades all Track Targets to
System Targets.
System Target




You can position the acquisition cursor over any System Target to increase its scan priority, making it a Cursor
Target.




Cursor Target




Scan Limit Lines




The radar will limit its scan to a 3-bar, ±25° pattern centered on that target to provide faster updates and reduce
the chance of losing the Cursor Target. This does not designate the target for AIM-120 employment, only
increases its priority for radar updates.
The Cursor Target can be changed by slewing the cursor to another system target. Slewing away from all
system targets returns the radar to a normal TWS scan.
A System Target can be designated as the Bugged Target by placing the radar cursor over it and pressing
TMS Forward. This changes the scan to a 3-bar, ±25° pattern centered on the bugged target to provide faster
updates and reduce the chance of losing the track.




Bugged Target




Scan Limit Lines




The Bugged Target is also selected for weapons employment. AIM-9 and AIM-120 DLZ information in the HUD
and FCR format references the Bugged target.
TMS Right will select the closest System Target as the bugged target. Subsequent presses of TMS Right will
cycle through all displayed System Target in range order, making each the Bugged Target in turn.
The Bugged Target can be transitioned to an STT lock by pressing TMS Forward with the cursor over the
Bugged Target. This will transition the radar to STT mode.
Pressing TMS Aft downgrades a Bugged Target to a System Target, or a System Target to a Tracked Target.


Air Combat Mode (ACM)
The Air Combat Mode (ACM) automatically acquires aircraft at short ranges. This mode is used most often
when the target is already acquired visually. The pilot flies the aircraft to position the target in the proper
position for radar acquisition.
Different scan patterns are available in the four different sub-modes:
• Boresight (BORE)
• 10° × 60° (Vertical Scan)
• 30° × 20° (HUD Scan)
• Slewable
The radar locks the first target it detects within each sub-mode’s search pattern. Maximum acquisition range is
10 nautical miles. Each sub-mode has its own strengths and weaknesses and is best used in different
situations.
ACM may be entered in two ways:
- Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT. This selects ACM automatically.
Or,
- Press the OSB next to the radar mode and select ACM from the options on the left of the screen.


Radar Mode




Mode Selection




The 30° × 20° sub-mode is entered in a non-radiating (NO RAD) state by default when ACM mode is selected.
The radar is activated when a sub-mode is selected by either cycling through sub-modes on the MFD or using
the Target Management Switch (TMS).




Sub-mode Selection




HOTAS functions of the TMS in ACM radar mode and the radar as SOI are:
Target Management
Switch




- TMS Up: Boresight (BORE) Sub-mode
- TMS Down: 10° × 60° (Vertical Scan)
- TMS Right: 30° × 20° (HUD Scan)
- TMS Left: No function


30° × 20° (HUD Scan) Sub-mode
The 30° × 20° HUD scan pattern searches an area slightly larger than the HUD field of view. The lock range is
10 nautical miles. The radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When locked, the target is
automatically tracked in STT mode.
There is no special HUD symbology for this sub-mode. The FCR format will display “ACM 20.”




Scan Zone




This sub-mode is less precise than the BORE sub-mode and may take longer to achieve a lock because of the
larger target area for the radar scan to cover.
Boresight (BORE) Sub-mode
The BORE scan pattern searches a small one-beamwidth area located 3° below the HUD’s gun cross. An
additional Boresight Cross is displayed on the HUD at the center of the radar scan zone to aid in positioning
the target in the radar beam.
The FCR format will display “ACM BORE.”




Scan Zone


BORE Cross




BORE is useful for quickly locking a target within visual range (WVR) and allows a degree fine control as to the
target being locked. The first target detected within 20 nautical miles is locked and automatically tracked in STT
mode.


10° × 60° (Vertical Scan) Sub-mode
In the 10° × 60° vertical scan sub-mode, the radar searches an area with 10° in width and 60° in the vertical.
The scan center is 23° above the HUD’s gun cross. This mode is indicated by a vertical line extending from the
gun cross to the bottom of the HUD.
The FCR format will display “ACM 60.”
HUD Line




Scan Zone




The lock range is 10 nautical miles. The radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When
locked, the target is automatically tracked in STT mode.
This mode is most often used during air combat maneuvering (ACM) dogfights. During such fights, you are
often trying to place the target on the lift vector and “pull” the target into the HUD. When in this mode, you can
often lock on to the target earlier, even when it is well above the HUD frame.


Slewable Sub-mode (later in early access)
The scan pattern is approximately 20° high × 60° wide. When selected, the scan is centered directly in front of
the aircraft on the horizon. The scan is slewable via the CURSOR/ENABLE control until a target is acquired.
The amount of slew is limited by the radar gimbal limits.
The FCR format will display “ACM SLEW.”
As with the other sub-modes, the radar automatically locks on to the first target in this zone. When locked, the
target is automatically tracked in STT mode.
This mode is useful when you have a direction to look, for example ‘bandits 2 o’clock high’, but have not picked
them up visually yet.


Single Target Track (STT) Mode
After you have locked the target from RWS or ACM sub-modes, the radar will change to STT mode. The radar
now focuses all its energy on a single target and provides constant updates. However, the radar will no longer
detect other contacts and the enemy may be alerted by this radar lock.
The MFD display in STT mode remains much the same as RWS mode with these differences: The locked
radar target is displayed as a circled triangle symbol with a flight vector line. The target’s altitude is displayed
below the target symbol. The top of the display shows aspect angle, ground track (direction the contact is
traveling over the ground), calibrated airspeed, and closure rate.

frequencies within the agility band, to increase the difficulty of being jammed.
Power Management. Not implemented.
Radar Level. Not implemented.
Target History. Sets the number of frames that a radar return lives (default 3). When set to 1, a radar return is
only displayed during the frame that it is detected. When set to 2, 3, or 4, the radar return is displayed for
additional scan frames, becoming dimmer with each new frame. By setting the target history, you can get a
broad idea of target relative bearing, since the frames will appear to form a line.
Altitude Tracker. Toggles on and off the altitude line tracker/blanker (not implemented). When on, blanks all
targets which are detected at the range of the altitude line.
Moving Target Rejection. Sets the minimum relative velocity that a detected aircraft must have before it is
displayed (Doppler gate). Not implemented.


Expand (EXP) Feature
The radar provides the ability to enter an expanded field of view display that allows sorting and resolution of
closely grouped contacts. This can be thought of as a zoom feature that provides a 4:1 scale view centered
around the radar cursor. This feature is available in all radar modes.
The expanded display may be toggled on or off by selecting the OSB next to NORM/EXP or by pressing the
Expand/FOV Button (pinky switch) while the FCR is sensor of interest.

IFF Interrogation
The Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) system allows interrogation of aircraft to determine if they are friendly or
hostile. This is done by transmitting a coded signal aimed at a specific radar contact or volume of space within
the selected radar azimuth and elevation. Transponders in friendly aircraft receive this signal and reply with the
correct coded response.
Contacts are classified based on the response and symbols identifying contacts as friendly or hostile are
displayed on the radar screen. The IFF system is not radar dependent so interrogation of contacts is still
possible with the radar off.
The IFF Master Switch must be set to NORM or LOW on the IFF panel to enable IFF interrogation.


Master Switch




Interrogation is initiated by HOTAS command in one of two modes:
- Scan. Press TMS Left short (1 second or less) to interrogate all contacts in the radar scan volume.
- Line of Sight (LOS). Press TMS Left long (more than 1 second) to interrogate the locked target or
immediate area around the radar cursor.

If the contact is friendly a green circle is drawn around the contact for three seconds. If no reply is received, no
indication is displayed, and the contact is classified as unknown. These contacts may be assumed to be hostile
depending on the rules of engagement (ROE) in your current scenario.

AIR-TO-GROUND MODES
The air-to-ground radar operates in six different selectable modes:
- Ground Map (GM)
- Ground Moving Target (GMT)
- Sea Search (SEA)
In addition, there are three additional modes that the radar uses in certain situations:
- Fixed Target Track (FTT)
- Air-to-Ground Ranging (AGR)
- Situational Awareness Mode (SAM)
Currently, the GM and SEA sub-modes are selectable.


Ground Mapping (GM) Mode
The Ground Mapping mode is a B-scope raster scan of terrain ahead of the aircraft. Image intensity is a
function of the strength of a radar return. Certain ground features will have higher intensity (e.g., buildings or
vehicles) and others will have lower intensity (e.g., water). Terrain or tall structures will impede the radar beam
from traveling further, creating distinctive shadows, giving the resulting image the appearance of an elevation
relief map.
Normally, the radar only scans the area around the SPI, regardless of aircraft location or heading. If the SPI
moves outside the radar field of view, the radar antenna is boresighted. To scan directly ahead of the aircraft
instead, use Snowplow (SP) Mode.
The ground mapping mode operates in one of four sub-modes:
- NORM: Normal mode
- EXP: Expanded mode, a 4:1 expansion of the NORM scan area.
- DBS1: Doppler beam sharpening mode level 1. The DBS mode can create a higher-resolution image
than the enhanced ground mapping mode, though it takes longer to render the image. DBS level 1
produces a 24:1 sharpening. The rendered area is the same size as EXP mode.
- DBS2: Doppler beam sharpening mode level 2. Level 2 creates an even sharper image, at 64:1, but
raster takes three times longer than DBS1. The rendered area depends on range to target, with a
minimum of 8 NM square.

Auto/Manual Range. Pressing this OSB toggles between AUTO and MAN (manual) range control. When in
AUTO mode, moving the crosshairs to the top or bottom of the display increases or decreases the range. The
label displays the mode that will be set if the OSB is pressed: AUTO is displayed when manual mode is active,
and MAN is displayed when automatic mode is active.
Gain Indicator. The scale indicates the range of possible radar gain values. The caret indicates the current
radar gain. Radar gain is adjusted with the GAIN rocker to the left. Higher gain values will produce a brighter
image but may wash out details.
Scan Width. Press to cycle between azimuth width options. The radar will only scan inside that azimuthal area.
Options are A6 (60° to each side of center), A2 (20° to each side), and A1 (10° to each side). Decreasing scan
azimuth will increase refresh rate but hinder situational awareness.
RBM/EGM. Toggles between Real Beam Mode (RBM) or Enhanced Ground Map (EGM). RBM uses raw radar
data to quickly produce an image. EGM uses post-processing to improve the image resolution but takes longer
to render an image. When EGM is on, only the center portion of the radar image is post-processed. EGM is not
available at large bank angles.
Crosshairs. The crosshairs indicate the current sensor point of interest (SPI). When not in snowplow mode, the
Cursor Enable control can be used to move the crosshairs and change the SPI.
B/R to SPI. Displays the bearing and range from the aircraft’s position to the SPI.
Time to Go. Displays the time (minutes:seconds) until reaching the SPI.

Freeze. Pressing this OSB puts the radar in standby mode and freezes the current radar image on the display.
See Freeze (FZ) Function, below.
Snowplow. Pressing this OSB moves the crosshairs to the center of the display and causes the radar to scan
in front of the aircraft, regardless of its location relative to the SPI. See Snowplow (SP) Mode, below.
Cursor Zero. Pressing this OSB resets all cursor slew. See Sensor Point of Interest (SPI).
Sighting Option. Toggles between different sighting options. The selected sighting option determines the
relationship between the current steerpoint and the SPI. (Not implemented.)
- STP. SPI is the current steerpoint. Default in NAV master mode.
- TGT. SPI is the designated target (or the current steerpoint if no target is designed). Default in A-G
master mode.
- OA1. SPI is Offset Aimpoint 1 for the current steerpoint.
- OA2. SPI is Offset Aimpoint 2 for the current steerpoint.
- RP. SPI is the Visual Reference Point for the current steerpoint (see Using Visual Reference Points).
- IP. SPI is the Visual Initial Point for the current steerpoint (see Using Visual Initial Points).
- SP (sensor point). Displayed when TMS Forward is pressed. SPI is the location designated on the
FCR format.

Fixed Target Track (FTT)
When a location is designated with TMS Forward, the radar enters FTT sub-mode. This sub-mode has identical
symbology and operation to the FZ (Freeze) function, described above, although the radar beam remains
locked on the designated location and is no longer used to create a raster image.
FTT is appropriate for tracking fixed ground targets or slow-moving sea targets such as ships. To track moving
land targets or fast-moving sea targets, use Ground Moving Target (GMT) mode (will be implemented later).
When in FTT, the designated location becomes the SPI. The radar will continue to track the target location while
line-of-sight is maintained. If LOS is lost, the radar will coast for 10 seconds before the radar returns to GM or
SEA mode. If the designated location moves outside the radar field of view, the radar will slew to boresight until
the target returns into the radar FOV, at which point the radar will reacquire the target. If the target remains
outside the radar FOV for 60 seconds, the radar will return to GM or SEA.

Snowplow (SP) Mode
In Snowplow mode, the radar scans directly ahead of the aircraft, independent of the SPI location. The radar
cursor is fixed at the center of the display.
Pressing TMS Forward while in Snowplow mode ground-stabilizes the cursor and exits Snowplow mode. You
can then either designate a target, or press Cursor Zero (CZ) if desired to reset the cursor to the steerpoint
location.


Sea Search (SEA) Mode
SEA mode works identically to GM mode (see above). SEA mode is appropriate for tracking slow-moving or
stationary objects on the water’s surface.




Radar Return
LINK 16 DATALINK
OVERVIEW
The aircraft relies on the Multifunction Information Distribution System (MIDS) radios that allow the transmission
and reception of data over the Link 16 Tactical Data Information Link (TADIL) network. Link 16 allows NATO
and other services to share data with each other.
Link 16 is part of the MIDS radio system and must be activated by rotating the MIDS LVT knob on the Avionics
Power Panel to the ON position. The DL switch next to the knob is not applicable to this block of the F-16C and
may be left OFF if desired.




The primary purpose of Link 16/MIDS is to provide a near-real-time picture of the tactical area around the pilot’s
aircraft. Data from ownship sensors, other friendly fighters on the network, and surveillance assets like AWACS
are correlated to create a unified situational awareness picture. This in turn allows a more coordinated
engagement and less chance of fratricide.
DISPLAY SYMBOLOGY
Each trackfile is represented by a symbol on the HSD and Radar Display. Depending on the shape and color,
you can determine whether it is friendly or hostile, and what the source of the track is; onboard systems,
offboard donors, or a combination of the two.

The Radar Display presents the information in much the same way as the HSD but includes an additional
identifier when a target is ‘bugged’ as the primary target by another donor aircraft on the network. This is a great
aid to target sorting as it allows the pilot to prioritize targets not being engaged by other aircraft in the area.

FD11, EN23, CY14, etc. The first and last letters of the callsign and flight position number is displayed when a
target is bugged by a donor that is not a member of the pilot’s flight. For example, FD11 identifies Ford 11,
CY14 identifies Chevy 41, and so on.
M. The target is bugged by multiple donors.
Bugged targets are identified differently on the HSD than on the radar display. A dashed cyan Wingman
Lockline is drawn from wingmen to their currently bugged targets. Wingman Locklines are only displayed for
flight members and not for all donors on the network.
Bugged Target IDs are shown on the radar display only and Wingman Locklines are displayed on the HSD only.

LITENING AT TARGETING
POD
OVERVIEW
The targeting pod provides you the ability to view, track, or designate targets day or night. There are two live
video modes: Charge Coupled Device (CCD) (like a TV display) and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) in both
Black Hot and White Hot sub-modes.
The main function modes and sub-modes for the TGP include:
- Standby (STBY)
- Air-to-Ground (A-G)
o Slave (Ground)
o AREA Track
o POINT Track
o INR Track
o Laser Spot Search (LSS)
- Air-to-Air (A-A)
- Slave (Body)
o POINT Track
o RATE Track
o HUD
Each of these modes also has a Control Page that provides you with the ability to configure TGP features.
TGP ACTIVATION
The following switches must be set on the Avionics Power Panel for all TGP features to function:
- MMC switch – MMC
- ST STA switch – ST STA
- MFD switch – MFD
- UFC switch – UFC
- INS – NORM
Power is applied to the TGP from the Sensor Control Panel:
- RIGHT HDPT switch – RIGHT HDPT
Select TGP from the MFD Menu to access the TGP page.




TGP Page Select




When the TGP is initially activated, the Standby page will be displayed with a “NOT TIMED OUT” message
displayed in the upper center portion. Time is needed to run automatic power-up self-tests and for the FLIR
sensor to cool down.
A “FLIR HOT” message is displayed in white text on a black background with half the text height as the “NOT
TIMED OUT” message. After about three minutes, the message will be removed, video will appear, and the
Standby mode page will be selected.
STANDBY (STBY) MODE
This will be the first TGP mode screen displayed upon activation of the TGP. After the “NOT TIMED OUT”
message has been removed (after 3 minutes), the mode may be exited by selecting one of the other two TGP
modes or the standby control page.
The following OSB functions may be displayed:

within the TGP field of view double in size from 0 to 9 zoom.
AGM-65 Handoff Sub-mode. This OSB toggles between MAN and AUTO for AGM-65D/G Maverick hand off
mode.
- MAN. The AGM-65 will be slaved to the Line of Sight of the TGP but will not automatically be handed
off the lock. Pilot must manually change SOI to AGM-65 and command lock manually.
- AUTO. TMS right will hand off the lock to the AGM-65 if the target contrast and size meets criteria of
missile lock.
Current Mode. This is the mode the TGP is currently in.
SPI Coordinates/Elevation. The lat/lon coordinates and elevation in feet of the current System Point of Interest
(SPI) is displayed. This is usually the point in the center of the crosshairs at ground level.
Grayscale. When pressed, it displays a 10-stage gray scale bar at the bottom of the display. When enabled,
the label changes to GRAY ON.
Situational Awareness Cue. The SA cue provides you a reference to indicate the TGP’s current line of sight in
reference to the pod’s longitudinal (boresight) axis, which is coincidental with the aircraft longitudinal axis. The
cue is represented as a small square that can move to any spot within the display. The position of the SA
square represents the current TGP line of sight.
Gain Control. Pressing this OSB toggles between manual and automatic gain control for the FLIR video.
- MGC. If selected, level control arrows are displayed on the OSBs below (not shown). Gain may be
controlled with the physical gain rocker switch on the top left of the MFD. The current selected gain is
indicated on the top left corner of the TGP page (not shown).

removed.
Note: The AGC/MGC label and associated OSB labels are displayed even if the TGP is in TV mode.
Crosshairs. Line of sight for targeting and laser fire.
Field of View (FOV) Indicators. These four corner brackets are only shown when WIDE FOV is enabled and
indicate the portion of the image that will be displayed if NARO FOV is enabled.
Track Mode. If the TGP is in a track mode, this field will indicate the track mode it is in. Types include:
- AREA. In AREA track mode, the TGP performs image correlation to track an overall scene. AREA
track mode is effective at tracking fixed objects.
- POINT. In POINT track mode, the TGP attempts to follow the centroid of a visible object using edge
detection. POINT track mode is effective at tracking moving objects that are well-defined against their
background, either because they are warmer (in HOC/COH sub-modes) or brighter (TV sub-mode).
- INR (inertial rates). In INR mode, the TGP maintains its LOS on a position using only inertial
integration. It does not do any image processing. INR track mode is effective at approximately
maintaining the TGP LOS when the target is at risk of being masked or obscured.
Slant Range to SPI. This indicates the slant range in nautical miles to the SPI. The preceding letter indicates
the source of the range data.
- L. Laser (priority over all other sources)
- T. TGP passive ranging
- (blank). Sensor that is not the TGP is providing range (for example, FCR A-G ranging)
Laser Code. If the laser is firing (flashing L), the targeting pod laser code being used should display the code
as set on the LASR DED page. This is an octal value of 1 to 8 with a range between 1111 and 2888.

- TV. The Charge Coupled Device camera displays this image. This is a daytime, electro-optical
camera.
North Arrow. The north arrow cue consists of the letter N with an arrow, displayed on the top right corner of the
TGP base page. The arrow points to magnetic north in 1.4° increments relative to the TGP cross hairs line of
sight.
Laser Spot Search Code. This is the laser pulse rate frequency (PRF) code the TGP will attempt to locate in
laser spot search (LSS) mode.
Track Polarity. For either FLIR or TV, pressing this OSB toggles between Neutral Track (NT) and White Track
(WT). When TV is selected, the OSB cycles between NT, WT, and Black Track (BT).
- NT mode allows both white and black targets to be point tracked. This is the default A-G mode.
- WT only allows white point targets to be tracked. This is the default A-A mode
- BT allows black point targets to be tracked.
Pressing this OSB twice within 0.5 seconds toggles the Laser Spot Tracker (LST) function on and off.
Snowplow Mode. This mode is available in NAV and A-G modes while the TGP is not tracking. This mode is
available when SP is displayed adjacent to the OSB (not shown). When SP is pressed, both the FCR and TGP
are commanded to snowplow mode.
In snowplow mode, the TGP LOS is commanded straight ahead and angled downwards to point to the ground
ahead at ½ of the currently selected FCR scale (for example, if selected FCR scale is 40nm, the TGP will look
at the point on the ground 20nm ahead). Because the location determined by the reticle is snowplowing, the SPI
itself will also snowplow.
Slewing is disabled; however, it is possible to ground-stabilize by pressing TMS-fwd. This will exit SP mode and
enter a normal AREA track.
Meterstick. The meterstick is a number to the right of the reticle that indicates the length of the ground under
the crosshair, in meters.
Cursor Zero. Pressing CZ erases the cursor slew and returns the SPI to the currently selected steerpoint.
Sighting Option. This OSB will cycle between TGT-OAP1-OAP2 where OAP is the Offset Aim-Point (OAP)
which can be added to each steer point. An OAP can be useful if the target is obscured by weather, but the
OAP is in the clear. By selecting OAP1 or 2, the TGP slaves to the clear OAP and the aiming can be confirmed,
although the steering and weapon delivery calculations will be to the target.
Laser Status. This displays the current state of the laser designator.
- (blank). Laser not armed
- L. Laser armed.
- Flashing L. Laser firing.
Time to Go. This shows the time to the next event depending on the aircraft status. Time to reach the
steerpoint is displayed if in NAV master mode. Time to release weapon is displayed if in A-G mode if a target
has been designated in an auto-delivery mode. Time to impact is displayed if a weapon has been released.
Weapons delivery using the TGP in A-G mode is covered in the Laser Guided Bombs section.


Track Modes
The LITENING II targeting pod can employ one of three different modes to track a target: AREA, POINT, INR
(inertial rates), and SP (snowplow). Each track mode is suitable for a different situation.
- In AREA track mode, the TGP performs image correlation to track an overall scene. AREA track
mode is effective at tracking fixed objects.
- In POINT track mode, the TGP attempts to follow the centroid of a visible object using edge detection.
POINT track mode is effective at tracking moving objects that are well-defined against their
background, either because they are warmer (in HOC/COH sub-modes) or brighter (TV sub-mode).
- In INR mode, the TGP maintains its LOS on a position using only inertial integration. It does not do
any image processing. INR track mode is effective at approximately maintaining the TGP LOS when
the target is at risk of being masked or obscured.
- In SP mode, TGP LOS is commanded straight ahead and angled downwards to point to the ground
ahead at ½ of the currently selected FCR scale (for example, if selected FCR scale is 40nm, the TGP
will look at the point on the ground 20nm ahead).
Therefore, it is recommended to use AREA track mode for stationary targets and POINT track mode for moving
targets. In situations where the targeting pod is likely to become masked (intensive maneuvering, concealment
behind terrain, or turning away from the target), it’s recommended to first change the TGP to INR track mode to
preserve the LOS as best as possible. SP mode is useful for locating targets directly ahead without reference to
steerpoints or other anchor points loaded into the aircraft.
When the targeting pod is initially brought out of standby, it is not in any track mode. The pilot can move the
targeting pod between track modes using the TMS switch:
INR MODE AREA MODE POINT MODE SP MODE
TMS Commands POINT Commands POINT Commands
FORWARD track track POINT track
TMS RIGHT Commands AREA Commands AREA Commands
track track AREA track
TMS DOWN Commands Cursor Commands INR Commands INR
Zero track track




Targeting pod in INR (inertial rates) track mode (crosshair is enlarged)
Targeting pod in AREA track mode




Targeting pod in POINT track mode (box encloses track target)

When the TGP cursor is slewed, the targeting pod automatically and temporarily changes to INR track mode.
The previous track mode (AREA or POINT) is re-commanded once slewing stops.


Laser Ranging
One very important feature of the Targeting Pod’s laser designator is the ability to measure the slant range to
the target. The laser is fired and the time it takes to receive the reflected laser energy is measured, providing a
precise range. This information is then fed to the Fire Control Computer to update the stored target elevation
and greatly improve the accuracy of the computed firing solution.
This can and should be done when possible for all weapons delivery types, not just laser guided bombs. To
facilitate this, the TGP automatically slaves to the pipper while in gun, rocket, and bomb CCIP modes, and to
the target designator while in CCRP and DTOS modes.
These weapons delivery modes are discussed fully in the Air-to-Ground Employment section.
To take a laser range, the Laser Arm Switch must be set to ARM. Laser firing is inhibited with the switch set to
OFF.




The Laser status is displayed as an L on the HUD and TGP display when the Laser Arm switch is set to arm.
The laser is fired by squeezing the trigger to the first detent. The L flashes when the laser designator is firing.
Releasing the trigger stops lasing.




Laser Status
AIR-TO-AIR (A-A) MODE
The TGP is automatically commanded to the radar line-of-sight when A-A master mode is selected, and the
radar is tracking a target. If the radar is not tracking an aerial target, the pod directs its line-of-sight straight
ahead at -3° elevation.
From the boresight, you may slew the TGP crosshair using the CURSOR switch. When slewing, the TGP
camera moves in a space stabilized manner. When in this slewed mode, but not tracking a target, “RATES” is
indicated on the display. After being slewed, the crosshairs will be reduced to half-size.
If the valid air target passes within the narrow field of view area (represented by the four corner markers), the
TGP will attempt to track the target and place a cross “+” on it. If the target flies outside the narrow field of view
area, the cross will disappear.
If you then command TMS Forward Short HOTAS command (command point track), the target will be centered
in the crosshair and a box will be drawn around the target to conform to its size. When in this mode, “POINT”
will be displayed as well as the tracking cross. To exit POINT track, the user may command INR track (TMS
Right) or return to slave mode (TMS Aft).

RATES mode (indicated in the tracking-type field).
- POINT. As with A-G mode, the user may command a Point track over an object. This mode is also
used for radar locked targets.
Situational Awareness Cue. The SA cue provides you a reference to indicate the TGP’s current line of sight in
reference to the pod’s longitudinal (boresight) axis, which is coincidental with the aircraft longitudinal axis. The

HELMET-MOUNTED
CUEING SYSTEM
OVERVIEW
The Helmet Mounted Cuing System (HMCS) is a bolt-on kit to the flight helmet that always allows the pilot to
view aircraft and weapon information on the helmet visor. This is referred to as the Helmet Mounted Display
(HMD).
It also allows the slaving of sensors and weapons to the helmet’s line of sight. This is a particularly effective
system when paired with the AIM-9X high off-boresight dogfight missile. The helmet can slave weapons and
sensor up to 80° off boresight.
Power to the HMD is selected from the HMD control knob on the left auxiliary console. Rotating the knob
clockwise from the OFF position to INC (increase) provides power to the HMD. Continued clockwise rotation
increases HMD brightness.




Symbology on the HMD is only visible in the right eye. This may cause discomfort in VR so you may change the
way it is rendered in the DCS: World options F-16C Special tab. These options are available:




Weapons delivery using the HMCS is covered in the following sections:
AIM-9M/X HMCS Missile BORE Employment
AIM-9M/X HMCS Radar BORE Employment


Alignment
To use the HMCS, it must be aligned prior to takeoff. HMCS alignment is completed for you if the mission
begins with your aircraft already started, but for cold-start missions, you must complete the HMCS alignment
yourself. To align the HMCS, do the following:
1. Power on the HMCS by rotating the HMCS knob out of “OFF”.
2. Press LIST to show the LIST menu on the DED, then press M-SEL (0) to enter the MISC menu, and
finally RECALL to enter the HMCS menu.
3. Press the dobber switch right to view page 2. Verify that the cursors are around the COARSE
alignment option.




4. Press M-SEL (0). The coarse alignment cross will be displayed on the HUD and HMD.

DROLL Cross




8. Use the TDC to align the DX/DY cross with the HUD cross, and then press M-SEL (0).




9. The cursor will advance to the ROLL phase. Press M-SEL (0) to begin the ROLL alignment.
10. The text in the HUD will change to “FA DROLL.” Use the TDC to rotate the DROLL cross until it’s
aligned with the bottom portion of the alignment cross.
11. Once alignment is satisfactory, press M-SEL (0). Alignment mode will exit, and alignment is complete.
After aligning, you can turn off the HMCS using the Power knob if desired.


Non-Designated Mode
The basic features of the HMCS can be illustrated in the non-designated mode. This can be thought of as an
extension of the HUD, with much of the symbology mimicked on the HMD. These features apply to all HMCS
modes:

Master Arm Status. Master Arm Switch Position: OFF, ARM or SIM.
Master Mode. Current Master Mode.
Bearing/Range to Bullseye. Bearing and range from your aircraft to the Bullseye.
Altitude. Duplication of the HUD barometric altitude.
Dynamic Aiming Cross. While in A/A mode in the HMD, the aiming cross can be in one of three locations on
the HMD, based on HMD view angle.
- When HMD LOS is 0° or less above the stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered in the HMD.
- When HMD LOS is between 0° and 30° above stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered
between the airspeed and altitude indicators on the HMD.
- When HMD LOS is greater than 30° above stabilized horizon, the aiming cross is centered above the
heading tape on the HMD.
Distance to Target. Displays distance to target or steerpoint in nautical miles. Displays “XXX” when no target is
locked.
Helmet Heading. Heading scale and number indicates helmet line of sight heading (not aircraft heading).
RWR Display. Displays the priority RWR threat surrounded by a circle. Plotted on the circle is a diamond
indicating threat direction relative to aircraft nose. (Aircraft nose is at the 12 o’clock position.) The small gap in
the circle indicates helmet LOS direction. When the gap is aligned with the diamond, the pilot’s head is facing
the threat.
The RWR display is blanked when there is no priority threat. The RWR display can also be inhibited from the
LIST→MISC→HMCS page on the DED (see HMCS Page).
AIR-TO-AIR EMPLOYMENT
AIR COMBAT PREPARATION
Remember to anticipate what is coming up next and stay ahead of the curve. You do not have to wait until you
are about to make an attack to set the aircraft up.
When entering an area where you expect to encounter enemy aircraft, you will want to take the following steps:
1. Position the Master Arm Switch to ARM. Weapons may be released normally when in the ARM
position. If the Master Arm switch is placed in the SAFE position, weapon release is inhibited.




2. Press the A-A Master Mode Button on the ICP to place the fire control system in Air-to-Air Missile
 (AAM) Mode.




This is one method for preparing the aircraft for an air-to-air attack. There are also two air-to-air override modes
that can be quickly selected using HOTAS commands. Those are described below.
DOGFIGHT AND MISSILE OVERRIDE MODES
Two override modes are available to quickly configure the aircraft for an air-to-air engagement: Dogfight and
Missile Override. These modes are selected using the DOGFIGHT switch located on the throttle grip. It is a
three-position switch that overrides any mode except emergency jettison.




DOGFIGHT Switch




- DOGFIGHT (outboard). This mode provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and
AIM-9 Sidewinder missile delivery.
- MSL OVRD (inboard, unlabeled). This provides symbology for AIM-120 missile firing only. If no AIM-
120 is loaded, AIM-9s are selected.
- Center position. Returns to the last selected master mode.
Requests for master mode changes made using the ICP will be ignored while either of these modes are active.
Changes to missile or radar settings made while either override mode is active will be saved throughout the
mission. A common technique is to configure the displays, radar, and missiles for each mode as desired during
ground operations. This provides three distinct weapon delivery options (Dogfight, Missile Override and Default)
without the need to remove your hands from the controls.


Dogfight Mode
With the switch in the DOGFIGHT (outboard) position, the HUD is configured for Gun and AIM-9 missile firing.
The left MFD is configured with the radar in ACM Boresight mode and the right MFD is configured with the
Dogfight SMS page.
The Dogfight HUD combines elements of the Missile and Guns HUD modes into one decluttered display. Note
that the heading bar, flight path marker and attitude bars are removed.

left MFD is configured with the radar in RWS mode and the right MFD is configured with the Missile SMS page.
See the section on AIM-120 AMRAAM Employment for details on each display and how to use them.
M6A1 20MM CANNON
The M61A1 20mm automatic gun system provides the pilot with a formidable weapon capability. It is a six-barrel
Gatling type gun mounted in the left strake of the aircraft. The system has a capacity of 512 rounds of
ammunition fired at 6,000 rounds per minute.


Gun Dispersion
Rounds fired from any gun system do not follow a perfectly straight path but are dispersed in a cone shaped
pattern after they leave the gun’s muzzle. The dispersion pattern becomes a larger and larger cone as slant
range increases. The density of rounds within the cone becomes less and less as the edge of the cone is
approached.
The average dispersion of the M61A1 is 8 mils diameter for 80% of the rounds fired and 12 mils for 100% of the
rounds fired.1 USAF units maintain a boresight program to ensure gun systems installed on aircraft continue to
meet these specifications while in operational use.
One mil is equal to 1/1000 of a radian so 8 mils equals an 8 foot diameter circle at 1,000 feet range and 12 mils
equals a 12 foot diameter circle. The size of the circle continues to increase with range.




In practical terms, this means you have some leniency in accuracy when firing the gun. In this example, the
green gun pipper is a 4-mil diameter circle. This is where bullets are most dense within the cone. The red
shaded area is the 8-mil circle 80% of the rounds will pass through at the target range. The orange shaded area
is the 12-mil circle that 100% of the rounds will pass through at the target range.




1
This is based on MIL-DTL-45500/1A that states “At a range of 1,000 inches, 80 percent of a 75 round (min.) burst shall be completely within an 8.0
inch diameter circle for accuracy” and the manufacturer’s data sheet that states “8 milliradians diameter, 80 percent circle”.
The dispersion pattern of rounds fired from the gun is a circle only if the target is perpendicular to the flight path.
It resembles an ellipse when firing against a horizontal target on the ground.




Summary
1. Select A/A master mode [1] or DGFT override mode [3]
2. Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
3. Acquire target using ACM radar mode (optional)
4. Fly the EEGS funnel and pipper onto the target
5. Squeeze the Trigger [Space] to the second detent to fire the gun



Air to Air Gunnery
1. There are two ways to get into the correct SMS configuration for air-to-air gunnery. They are:
- Select the Air-to-Air Gunnery operating mode on the MFD by pressing OSB 1 until GUN is
displayed, or
- Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
This provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and A-A missile delivery.

2. Verify A-A GUN symbology is displayed in the HUD.
The Enhanced Envelope Gun Sight (EEGS) provides different levels of information depending on
whether the radar is locked on the target.
Level I is a failure mode that only displays the Boresight Cross in the event of a Rate Sensor Unit
 (RSU) and INS failure. It should almost never be encountered.
Level II provides a prediction of the bullet path when there is no radar lock. The Boresight Cross,
EEGS Funnel and Multiple Reference Gunsight (MRGS) Lines are provided.
Level III and IV are intermediate levels that lead to the Level V display. These are usually not seen
by the pilot.
Level V is displayed after radar lock-on and a firing solution has been computed using that data.
Additional references in the HUD include the Target Designator, T-Symbol, Range to Target,
Closure Rate and Level V Pipper.

EEGS Sub-mode

MRGS Lines




Level II Symbology (no radar lock)

Boresight Cross. This symbol is always available and shows the boresight direction. This is the
direction rounds will travel before other influences like gravity or air resistance take effect.
EEGS Funnel. Each point along the funnel represents the target at a specific range for which the gun
is correctly aimed. In other words, an aircraft whose wings are the same width as the funnel is at the
correct range to be hit by rounds fired at that moment.
As the range decreases, the target size will increase. As this occurs, you must place the target higher
in the funnel to keep the target wingspan just touching the sides of the funnel. This results in placing
the target higher in the HUD or, more importantly, closer to the Boresight Cross which results in
reduced lead for the reduced range.
The target aircraft wingspan must be known for the funnel to provide accurate range information.
Multiple Reference Gunsight Lines. The MRGS sight is composed of a series of five line segments
pointing toward the Gun Bore Line, and spaced in an arc near the bottom of the HUD. They aid in
lining up long range, high aspect shots by providing the correct lateral aiming solution so the target
flies up the funnel.
When using an MRGS line, if the target is smaller than the line, it is either out of range or moving
faster than anticipated and requires extra lead. If the target is larger than the MRGS line, the target is
moving slower than anticipated and will require less lead.

Level V Symbology (with radar lock)

Target Designator. This symbol is centered on the locked radar target. The triangular Target
Aspect Caret shows the target’s aspect angle. Maximum effective gun range is shown by an In-
Range Cue, two small lines on the outside of the symbol. The position of the Target Range Caret
indicates the range to the locked target. Each o’clock position represents 1,000 feet of range, so:
- 12 o’clock = 12,000 ft
- 9 o’clock = 9,000 ft
- 6 o’clock = 6,000 ft
- 3 o’clock = 3,000 ft
Target Range. The distance to the locked target. Tenths of a mile are displayed for ranges greater
than one mile. Hundreds of feet are displayed at ranges less than one mile.
Closure Rate. The rate of closure with the target in knots.
T-Symbol. This symbol shows two firing solutions for the locked target. The + symbol, or ‘one-G
pipper’ shows the lead angle against a non-maneuvering target. The small horizontal bar, or ‘nine-G
pipper’ shows the lead angle for a target turning at maximum sustained rate. These may be used as
a backup in situations the Level V Pipper is not displayed.
Two maneuver potential lines are displayed on either side of the 1g pipper. The longer the lines, the
greater the out-of-plane maneuver potential of the target.
Level V Pipper. This represents the gunfire solution computed for the target’s current range and
rates. The goal is to stabilize this pipper over the target and fire.
3. Maneuver your aircraft to frame the target aircraft within the EEGS funnel.
Each point along the funnel represents the target at a specific range for which the gun is correctly
aimed. In other words, an aircraft whose wings are the same width as the funnel is at the correct
range to be hit by rounds fired at that moment.
Place the enemy aircraft in the funnel so that the wingtips touch the edges or the Level V Pipper is
stabilized over the target.
4. Squeeze the trigger all the way to the second detent to fire the gun when the wingtips touch
the funnel (Level II) or Pipper is over the target (Level V).
Target range greatly affects gun effectiveness. As the rounds come out of the gun, they will gradually
disperse and lose velocity. Increased dispersion and loss of velocity reduce the accuracy and
effectiveness of the gun. The top of funnel represents the minimum range of approximately 600 feet.
The bottom of the funnel represents the maximum range of approximately 3,000 feet. If the target is
smaller than the bottom of the funnel, it is out of range.

the last round has passed. This is only available with a radar lock and EEGS Level III, IV or V symbology
displayed.

AIM-9M/X SIDEWINDER
The AIM-9 is a short-range, infrared-guided missile best used in a dogfight. It is fire-and-forget and can be used
with or without a radar lock. The primary indication of a seeker lock is a higher-pitched lock tone. The seeker
can also be uncaged to ensure the seeker is tracking the target when it has first been sensor-slaved to the
target.
Note that the AIM-9 can be decoyed by flares and it’s a good idea to ensure you have a good seeker lock
before launching an AIM-9 with flares in the seeker field of view.

Summary
1. Select AAM [4] or DGFT [3] master mode
2. Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
3. Acquire target using radar (optional)
4. Maneuver until target is in launch zone
5. Depress Uncage switch [C] to command missile track (if required)
6. Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible
7. Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] switch to fire missile



AIM-9M/X Employment
1. There are two ways to get into the correct SMS configuration for firing an AIM-9. They are:
- Select AIM-9s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-9s are displayed, or
- Position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
This overrides any other master mode and configures the displays for air combat. The DOGFIGHT
position provides symbology on the HUD for both 20mm gun firing and A-A missile delivery. The MSL
position provides symbology on the HUD for A-A missile delivery only.

Available Stations
The number and type of missiles is displayed next to OSB 7. The stations with missiles loaded are
displayed at the bottom and the selected station is boxed. Step through available stations with the
MSL Step button or by selecting the adjacent OSB.
SPOT/SCAN commands the missile seeker to either scan in a narrow field of view (SPOT) or wide
field of view (SCAN). The wider field of view is achieved by seeker nutation around the line of sight.
Detection range is decreased when SCAN is used. SCAN mode is not currently implemented.
SLAVE/BORE commands the missile to either follow the radar line of sight (SLAVE) or keep looking
straight ahead down the boresight (BORE). Pressing and holding the CURSOR/ENABLE control
overrides the current selected option. Releasing the control returns to the option selected on the
MFD.
WARM/COOL activates or deactivates argon cooling of the seeker. This should be set to COOL
prior to an engagement to cool the seeker and increase detection sensitivity. COOL is selected
automatically when entering DGFT or MSL Override mode. Argon supply duration varies depending
on outside air temperature, pressure, and bottle charge level at installation, but the average duration
is 90 minutes.
2. Verify A-A Missile symbology is displayed in the HUD.
The air-to-air HUD provides information on the status and targeting of air-to-air missiles. Most of the
symbology from the NAV mode is retained but several new features are added to aid in target
acquisition and missile launch.
The Missile Diamond indicates the position of the AIM-9 seeker head. This starts at the seeker
boresight position but unlatches to follow the radar line of sight or track a locked target when a lock is
achieved.
The Missile Reticle shows the seeker field of view. This will be shown as different sizes depending
on the SPOT/SCAN field of view setting chosen on the MFD.

3. Acquire target using radar (optional).
Perhaps the most common and easiest way to target an aircraft with the AIM-9 is to acquire a target
with one of the ACM Radar Modes. This slews the AIM-9 seeker to the radar target if SLAVE is
selected on the missile. This results in an AIM-9 lock if the target is in range and other IR detection
conditions are met.
4. Maneuver until target is in launch zone.
Fly the missile reticle in the HUD over a target. If the missile detects enough IR energy from the
target, target detection is indicated by an audio missile detection tone (growling sound).
5. Press Uncage switch to command missile self-track.
When the AIM-9 seeker detects a target, it can be uncaged by pressing the Cage/Uncage button to
allow the seeker lock on and follow the target within the confines of the missile seeker’s field of view.
The Missile Diamond latches to the target when locked.
6. Verify missile diamond is on target and lock tone is audible.
The missile growl will become high pitched when the target is locked. A Target Designator Box will
be present over a target locked with radar. If firing against a radar target, the Missile Diamond
should be over the Target Designator box. The Target Range is displayed if radar is used.

7. Press the Weapon Release switch to fire the missile.
The missile will attempt to intercept the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected. The
AIM-9 is a fire and forget weapon so there is no need to continue tracking the target.


AIM-9M/X HMCS Missile BORE Employment
The HMCS allows the AIM-9M or AIM-9X missiles to slave to the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) Aiming Cross
when BORE mode is selected on the missile. This is useful in situations where no radar lock is possible or
desired. This can be thought of as normal AIM-9 employment, except the HMD line of sight is used instead of
the HUD line of sight. The mechanization is otherwise the same.
1. Turn on the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) symbology.
Power to the HMCS is selected from the HMD Symbology control knob on the left auxiliary console.
Rotating the knob clockwise from the OFF position to INC (increase) provides power to the HMD.
Continued clockwise rotation increases symbology brightness.




2. Select AIM-9s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-9s are displayed, or
position the Dogfight/Missile Override (DOGFIGHT) Switch to DGFT.
Symbology and functions are identical to non-HMCS employment. Set the Line-of-Sight mode to
BORE to use the HMCS for AIM-9M/X targeting without radar.

3. Acquire the target in the HMD.
With the AIM-9 set to BORE and the HMCS on, the seeker will follow the Dynamic Aiming Cross in
the HMD display. The aiming cross is treated as the boresight position. Simply look at the target
instead of flying the aircraft all the way into position for an AIM-9 lock.
Remember, you will still be constrained by the missile seeker gimbal limits when looking around. The
Missile Diamond shows where the missile seeker is looking. If you look beyond the missile seeker
gimbal limits, the diamond symbol will be displayed with an “X” through it and will be clamped to the
edge of the HMCS display area.
The other symbology on the display intentionally mimics the symbology from the HUD.

AIM-9M/X HMCS Radar BORE Employment
The HMCS also allows the Fire Control Radar to slave to the HMCS Aiming Cross when ACM BORE radar
mode is selected. This can be thought of as normal AIM-9 employment, except the HMD line of sight is used
instead of the HUD line of sight. The mechanization is otherwise the same.
1. Turn on the Helmet Mounted Display (HMD) symbology.

forward once, then simply look at the target instead of flying the aircraft all the way into position for a
radar lock.
Remember, you will still be constrained by the radar gimbal limits when looking around. The ACM

With the AIM-9 line of sight set to SLAVE, the seeker will slew to the radar line of sight. When the
AIM-9 seeker detects a target, it can be uncaged by pressing the Cage/Uncage button. This allows
the seeker to lock on and follow the target within the confines of the missile seeker’s gimbal limits.

The missile will attempt to intercept the target and the next missile in sequence will be selected. The
AIM-9 is a fire and forget weapon so there is no need to continue tracking the target.
AIM-120 AMRAAM
The AIM-120 AMRAAM is an Active Radar-Homing (ARH) air-to-air missile that can self-guide to a target using
an active radar seeker in its nose. The missile is guided initially via datalink commands from the launching
aircraft, and transitions to onboard active radar homing once within range. Because of the active seeker, the
pilot can engage multiple targets at once without needing to support the missile for its entire time of flight.
The AIM-120 is a medium range missile and can engage targets outside 20 nm. However, engagement range is
highly dependent on target aspect, engagement altitude, launch speed, and target post-launch maneuvering. As
such, the engagement range of the AIM-120 can be less than 10 nm in some situations.
In WVR combat, the AIM-120 can also be launched in BORE mode without a radar lock. Once the missile is
launched, it will track and attempt to hit the first target it detects within the AIM-120 reticle on the HUD.

AIM-120 Employment
Summary
1. Select A/A master mode [1] or MSL override mode [4]
2. Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
3. Acquire target using radar (optional but recommended)
4. Maneuver until target is in launch zone
5. Depress Weapon Release [RAlt]+[Space] switch to fire missile

1. There are two ways to select the AIM-120 for employment:
- Select AIM-120s on the MFD by pressing OSB 7 until AIM-120s are displayed, or
- Position the Dogfight/Missile Override Switch to MSL OVRD. This overrides any other master
mode and configures the displays for air combat. The MSL position provides symbology on the
HUD for A-A missile delivery and selects the longest-range missile type loaded.
2. Verify A-A Missile symbology is displayed in the HUD.
The air-to-air HUD provides information on the status and targeting of air-to-air missiles. Most of the
symbology from the NAV mode is retained but several new features are added to aid in target
acquisition and missile launch.
3. Acquire target using the radar
Typically, a target will be locked using RWS, TWS, or any ACM radar sub-mode and the AIM-120 set
to SLAVE.
When the locked target is outside the HUD field on view as shown below, a Target Locator Line
 (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross and points directly at the target. The Relative Angle is displayed
next to the Gun Cross showing the angle in degrees between the cross and the target.
The Allowable Steering Error Circle (ASEC) changes size and the Attack Steering Cue (ASC)
becomes visible. The Target Range is displayed after target radar lock.
4. Maneuver until Attack Steering Cue (ASC) is inside the Allowable Steering Error Circle (ASEC)
The size of the Allowable Steering Error Circle will vary depending on the target range and aspect.
Ensure that the Attack Steering Cue is located as close to the Allowable Steering Error Circle
center as possible when firing to achieve the best performance out of the missile.
When the target enters the HUD, the Target Designator Box will be displayed over the target and
the Missile Diamond will track that location.

target, and press Weapons Release again to fire the second missile. If using TWS, you can repeat
this process up to four times total.
AIR-TO-GROUND
EMPLOYMENT
ATTACK PREPARATION
Prior to reaching the target area and conducting your attack, you will want to configure several aircraft systems
ahead of time so that you can most efficiently communicate and set up your attack. When at a minimum of 40
nm from the target, you will want to take the following steps:
1. Position the Master Arm Switch to ARM. Weapons may be released normally when in the ARM
position. If the Master Arm switch is placed in the SAFE position, weapon release is inhibited.
2. Position the Laser Arm Switch to ARM. This is required to enable firing of the laser designator. Laser
firing is inhibited with the switch set to OFF.




3. Place the fire control system in A-G mode by pressing the A-G Master Mode Button on the ICP.
M6A1 20MM CANNON STRAFE
The M61A1 20MM automatic gun system provides the pilot with a formidable weapon capability. It is a six-barrel
Gatling type gun mounted in the left strake of the aircraft. The system has a capacity of 512 rounds of
ammunition fired at 6,000 rounds per minute.

Target Attack
Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve
the correct configuration and attack ground targets with the gun:
1. Select the STRF sub-mode on the MFD by pressing OSB 1 until GUN is displayed.

2. Verify STRF symbology is displayed in the HUD.
The Strafe Reticle is the default air to ground gunsight and provides aiming information required to
fire the gun effectively. The center of the reticle is the aiming pipper and represents where the gun
rounds will go assuming the target is within range. Using the pipper, it is simply a case of “putting the
thing on the thing” and pulling the trigger.
Line of sight range is indicated by the digital range numeric on the bottom right of the HUD and the
ranging reticle that winds or unwinds within the reticle. The position of the ranging reticle indicates the
slant range to the pipper’s position on the ground. Each quarter circle tick on the strafe reticle
represents 3,000 feet of slant range, so:
- 12 o’clock = 12,000 ft
- 9 o’clock = 9,000 ft
- 6 o’clock = 6,000 ft
- 3 o’clock = 3,000 ft
The in-range cue position may be set by the pilot provide an additional visual cue for the effective
range against the planned target.

3. Maneuver your aircraft to position the pipper on target.
One technique is to place the pipper short of the target and allow it to track along the ground until it
reaches the target. This will happen naturally as slant range decreases.




Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
4. Squeeze the trigger all the way to the second detent to fire the gun when the pipper is over the
target and you are within effective range.
In this example, the pipper is on-target at a slant range of about 5,500 feet as shown by the position
on the ranging reticle.
Slant range greatly affects gun effectiveness. As the rounds come out of the gun, they will gradually
disperse and lose velocity. Increased dispersion and loss of velocity reduce the accuracy and
effectiveness of the gun. Effective engagement range is generally from 2,500 to 7,000 feet. For
armored vehicles, closer is better, and you should attack from behind the target where its armor is
weakest.
When lining up a shot, be careful to avoid target fixation. Target fixation can lead to you not noticing
an unseen threat or pressing the attack too close. Don’t make yourself an easy target for the machine
gun on the top of that APC!
Once you have reached the minimum attack range, break off in both the horizontal and vertical to avoid hostile
return fire. You may also wish to release flares in case an infrared-SAM near the enemy target has been
launched at you, but you did not see it.


In-Range Cue Update
The position of the In-Range Cue on the reticle may be updated by selecting the OSB next to the In-Range Cue
distance on the SMS page.




In-Range Cue Distance
Type in the new in-range cue distance using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and select ENTR. You
may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page without making changes by

Aerial rockets pack more punch than the 20mm gun but are still best used as an area suppression weapon.
These come with different warhead options for different purposes including High Explosive (HE), High Explosive
Anti-Tank (HEAT), and Armor Piercing (AP). White Phosphorus (WP) rounds may also be used for incendiary
effect or to mark targets on the ground with their distinctive white smoke.

UNGUIDED BOMBS
Unguided bombs that the F-16C can employ fall into three categories: General Purpose (GP), Cluster, and
Training.


General Purpose Bombs
MK 82 LDGP. The standard MK 82 is a low drag “slick” bomb, also referred to as a Low Drag General Purpose
(LDGP) bomb. The bomb is aerodynamically streamlined with four conical tail fins for flight stability. The bomb
has a thin steel jacket that contributes to fragmentation effects.
The MK 82 may be carried singly on a Wing Weapons Pylon (WWP) or three may be loaded on a Triple Ejector
Rack (TER)
The MK 82 serves as the basis for several other bombs including the MK 82AIR, GBU-12, and GBU-38.
MK 82 AIR. This version of the MK 82 adds the BSU-49/B high drag tail assembly, also called a “ballute”. This
allows the bomb to rapidly slow down after release. By slowing down, you can release such a retarded weapon
at low altitude and not be caught in the blast effect of the weapon. You can choose to release the MK 82AIR in
either retarded or “slick” (no ballute deployed) modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release
retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze setting on the SMS page.
MK 82 SE. This ‘Snake Eye” version of the MK 82 pre-dates the MK 82 AIR and uses fins that deploy from the
Mk-15 tail assembly to slow the bomb’s fall. You can choose to release the MK 82 SE in either retarded or
“slick” modes. To drop as a slick, select only a nose fuze, and to release retarded, select nose/tail or tail fuze
setting on the SMS page.
MK 84 LDGP. The MK 84 is the big brother of the MK 82 and it weighs 2,039 lbs. with 945 lbs. of H-6 or Tritonal
high explosive. Although most effective against unarmored and lightly armored targets, the MK 84 can also be
effective against armored targets when dropped in proximity. The MK 84 can only be mounted on a WWP and
cannot be loaded on a TER.
The MK 84 forms the basis for other bombs including the GBU-10 and GBU-31 that the F-16C also carries.


Cluster Bombs
CBU-87. The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munitions (CEM) weighs 950 lbs. and is an all-purpose cluster bomb.
The SUU-65 Tactical Munitions Dispenser that makes the body of the bomb contains 202 BLU-97/B Combined
Effects Munitions (CEM) bomblets and they are effective against lightly armored and unarmored targets. The
dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) and RPM spin setting set with dials
on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. However, the general bomblet footprint coverage is 200 by 400
meters.
The CBU-87 can be mounted singly on a WWP. Only two may be loaded on a TER when wing external fuel
tanks are installed due to clearance constraints. This is commonly referred to as a ‘slant load’.
Each BLU-97/B CEB consists of a shaped charge, a scored steel casing, and a zirconium ring, for anti-armor
and anti-personnel fragmentation and incendiary effects. Each CEB is designed to fragment into 300 fragments.
Given the top attack angle of the weapon, the CEB can be effective against the generally light armor covering
the top of an armored vehicle such as a tank.
CBU-97. The CBU-97 is a 1,000-pound class weapon containing sensor-fused sub-munitions in a SUU-66B
Dispenser for specifically attacking armor. This Sensor Fused Weapon (SFW) contains 10 BLU-108/B sub-
munitions, and 40 “hockey puck” shaped skeet infrared sensing projectiles.
As with the CBU-87, the dispersal footprint of the bomblets depends on the Height of Function (HOF) set with
dials on the bomb and displayed on the SMS page. The RPM is not applicable on this dispenser. The same
carriage restrictions as the CBU-87 apply: one per WWP and two per TER.


Training Bombs
BDU-33. The BDU-33 is a miniaturized training bomb that mimics the ballistics of larger general-purpose
bombs. The BDU-33 contains a small smoke charge to help round spotting.


Unguided/Laser Guided Bombs SMS Page
The A-G SMS display and procedure for setting up an attack with guided or unguided bombs is very similar for
all types. The initial set-up will only be covered once, with differences in CCIP, CCRP sub-modes covered in
separate sections below.

Summary
1. Select A-G Master Mode [2]
2. Select bombs and set desired options on SMS A-G MFD

Upon selection of the A-G master mode, the SMS Air-to-Ground (SMS A-G) page is displayed on the right MFD.
Based on the priority weapon, the information on the SMS A-G page can vary. Follow these steps to achieve
the correct configuration and attack ground targets with GP bombs in CCIP mode:
1. Select the desired weapons on the MFD by pressing OSB 6 until the weapons you want to
release are displayed.

2. Select the desired profile for the selected weapons.
Two different profiles are pre-set by default. These include typical settings for delivery mode, fuze
arming option, bomb impact spacing, and release quantity. If a profile already matches your planned
attack profile, you are all set; no more changes are required! If not, follow the steps that follow in this
section to set the profile up to your liking.
Selecting the OSB next to the current profile to cycle between the two options: PROF1 and PROF2.




Selected Profile




Changes to settings made while a profile is selected are saved for later use. These should typically
be set or verified as part of aircraft startup, although they may be changed at any time.
3. Select your desired release sub-mode. (OSB 2)
If a sub-mode other than the one you want is selected, you may press OSB 2 to display the following
options:
- CCIP – Continuously Computed Impact Point
- CCRP – Continuously Computed Release Point
- DTOS – Dive Toss
- LADD – Low Altitude Drogue Delivery
- MAN – Manual
Then, select the OSB next to your desired sub-mode. That will set the new active sub-mode and
return you to the SMS A-G page.
Sub-mode Options




You may also cycle between sub-modes by pressing the Missile Step (MSL STEP) button on your
stick.
4. Set desired bomb fuzing option. (OSB 18)
Bombs are typically equipped with two fuzes, one in the nose and one in the tail. These are
sometimes set with different impact delay settings to provide the pilot with the choice of how the fuze
functions and when the bomb detonates after impact. Sometimes an instantaneous detonation is
desired for fragmentation effects and sometimes a delayed detonation is desired to allow target
penetration or cratering.
Selecting OSB 18 cycles between three fuze arming options: NOSE, TAIL and NSTL (Nose/Tail).
This is typically set to NSTL (Nose/Tail) for redundancy unless a specific effect is desired when the
weapon detonates.
Fuzing Option




There are also some special cases where the fuze option changes how the weapon behaves after
release:
- MK 82 AIR/SE
o NSTL – High Drag
o NOSE – Low Drag
o TAIL – High Drag
- CBU-87/97
o NSTL – Bomblets dispense using settings displayed on SMS page
o NOSE – Bomblets dispense immediately after release
o TAIL – Dud
5. Set desired Single/Pair option. (OSB 8)
Bombs may be released with either Single (SGL) or Pair (PAIR) selected. With SGL selected, bombs
will be released from only one station. With PAIR selected, bombs will be released from both opposite
stations, assuming identical bombs are loaded on stations 4 and 6 or 3 and 7.
Single/Pair Option




6. Set the desired release interval distance if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 9)
The timing between release pulses is computed by the aircraft to space multiple weapons in a ‘stick’
along the ground at the specified distance. Valid distances range from 10-999 feet. This setting has
no effect if only one bomb or one pair of bombs is released.




Interval Distance




Type in the new impact spacing distance using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and
select ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page
without making changes by selecting RTN.
Impact Spacing Distance




7. Set the number of release pulses if more than one bomb is to be released. (OSB 10)
This sets the number of release pulses sent to the weapons stations when the Weapon Release
button is pressed. For example, a setting of 1 releases only one bomb or pair of bombs at a time
while a setting of 4 releases four bombs or pairs of bombs at a time. This is commonly known as a
 ‘ripple release’.




Release Pulses




Type in the desired number of release pulses using the OSBs on the left and right of the display and
select ENTR. You may correct numbers entered in error by selecting RCL or return to the SMS page
without making changes by selecting RTN.
Release Pulses




Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack
The Continuously Computed Impact Point (CCIP) mode is a computed visual delivery mode with manual
weapon release. This mode allows a high degree of flexibility since the point on the ground at which the weapon
will impact is continuously indicated by a CCIP Pipper on the HUD. No target designation is required. Place the
thing on the thing and drop the bomb.

Summary
1. Select A-G Master Mode [2]
2. Set Master Arm Switch to Arm
3. Set Laser Arm Switch to Arm if laser ranging updates are desired

6. Depress the Weapons Release button [RAlt]+[Space] to expend weapons

1. Verify CCIP symbology is displayed in the HUD.
If the CCIP impact point does not lay within the HUD field of view, the Time Delay Cue (TDC) is
shown as a short, horizonal line on the Bomb Fall Line. The CCIP Pipper is outside the HUD field of
view when this is displayed. A second, ‘post-designate CCIP’ technique may be used in this situation
but that will be covered in the next section.

2. Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
When the TDC is no longer displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is in the HUD field of view.
That will be the impact point if the bombs are released immediately.
One technique is to place the FPM ahead of the target and the pipper just short of the target. Fly the
Bomb Fall Line over the target and allow the pipper to track straight up the line. This will happen
naturally as slant range decreases.

fuze to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more
immediate. It moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing
a bomb with the FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
Laser ranging may be performed to improve the computed firing solution if a targeting pod is installed.
See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
3. Press the Weapon Release button to release the bombs when the CCIP pipper is over the
target.
The pipper will be at the center of the ‘stick’ if more than one bomb is released in a ripple delivery.
Hold the Weapons Release button long enough to ensure all weapons come off. The FPM flashes

Unguided Bombs CCIP Attack (Post-Designate)
An additional option for CCIP bombs delivery is available for situations where the target cannot be within the
HUD field of view at release. This can sometimes happen on attacks from a shallow dive angle or high altitude.
The steps to enter CCIP mode are the same as described above. The difference is in when you press and hold
the Weapons Release button.
1. Maneuver your aircraft to position the CCIP Pipper on target.
When the Time Delay Cue is displayed on the Bomb Fall Line, the pipper is not in the HUD field of
view, however you will still place the pipper over the intended target.
You will designate that location as the target by pressing and holding the Weapons Release button.
The fire control computer will do the rest.

Unguided Bombs CCRP Attack
The Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs.
This can be done from a dive, but also from wings-level or a nose-high attitude.
This mode requires a target designation point from which to build the bombing solution. Command steering is
provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will release automatically at the proper time
such that the weapons hit the target.

LASER-GUIDED BOMBS
The development of laser guided weapons has dramatically improved the accuracy of weapon guidance and
delivery. With the assistance of build-up guidance kits, general GP bombs are turned into laser-guided bombs
(LGBs). The kits consist of a computer- control group (CCG), guidance canards attached to the front of the
warhead to provide steering commands, and a wing assembly attached to the aft end to provide lift. LGBs are
maneuverable, free-fall weapons requiring no electronic interconnect to the aircraft. They have an internal semi-
active guidance system that detects laser energy and guides the weapon to a target illuminated by an external
laser source. The designator can be in the delivery aircraft, another aircraft, or a ground source.
All LGB weapons have a Computer Control Group (CCG), a warhead (bomb body with fuze), and an airfoil
group. The computer section transmits directional command signals to the appropriate pair of canards. The
guidance canards are attached to each quadrant of the control unit to change the flight path of the weapon. The
canard deflections are always full scale (referred to as “bang, bang” guidance).
The LGB flight path is divided into three phases: ballistic, transition, and terminal guidance. During the ballistic
phase, the weapon continues via the unguided trajectory established by the flight path of the delivery aircraft at
the moment of release. In the ballistic phase, the delivery attitude takes on additional importance since
maneuverability of the LGB is related to the weapon velocity during terminal guidance. Therefore, airspeed lost
during the ballistic phase equates to a proportional loss of maneuverability. The transition phase begins at
acquisition. During the transition phase, the weapon attempts to align its velocity vector with the line-of-sight
vector to the target. During terminal guidance, the LGB attempts to keep its velocity vector aligned with the
instantaneous line-of-sight. At the instant alignment occurs, the reflected laser energy centers on the detector
and commands the canards to a trail position, which causes the weapon to fly ballistically with gravity biasing
towards the target.
GBU-10 Paveway II. This Guided Bomb Unit (GBU) weighs 2,562 lbs. and is basically a laser-guided version of
the Mk-84 unguided bomb with a general-purpose warhead. The laser detector on the nose of the seeker
detects the reflected energy of the designating laser at the set laser code. Once dropped, the wing-like airfoil
surfaces at the rear of the bomb extend and are used to maneuver the bomb to the laser designation point.
Rather than smooth and constant input of course-corrections to reach the target, the bomb uses a series of
discreet input corrections and this is often referred to as “bang-bang” guidance mode.
GBU-10 can only be hung from a MAU-12 ejector rack on stations 3, 4, 6, and 7.
Suitable targets for the GBU-10 are large and/or hardened targets that require an accurate and powerful strike.
Such targets often include bridges, bunkers, and hardened command posts.
GBU-12 Paveway II. This GBU is the laser-guided version of the Mk-82 unguided, general purpose bomb. The
GBU-12 guides using the same principles as the GBU-10, the only difference being the bomb the LGB is based
on.
The GBU-12 can be mounted singly on a MAU-12 ejector rack at stations 3, 4, 6, and 7. Only two may be
loaded on a TER when wing external fuel tanks are installed due to clearance constraints. This is commonly
referred to as a ‘slant load’.


Bomb Seeker Laser Code
The seeker head on each laser guided bomb is set to track only a specific laser pulse rate frequency (PRF)
code. These are manually set by the weapons load crew during ground operations and may not be set from the
cockpit during flight.
To replicate this, the laser code may be set using the mission editor. In this example, the laser code on each
bomb seeker head is 1564.
An additional method to set the bomb seeker laser code is included on the in-game kneeboard. You may
access this using keyboard command [RShift]+[K], then use the [ and ] (bracket) keys to access the page. Use
the keyboard commands listed to the right of each digit to change the laser code.
Bomb seeker laser codes can only be changed using this method on the ground prior to engine start and with
the STA POWER switch on the right console OFF.




The laser designator on the Targeting Pod must be set to match the code on the bomb. See the section on the
LASR DED Page for procedures.


SMS Page
The A-G SMS display and procedures for setting up an attack with guided or unguided bombs are identical. See
the section on the Bombs A-G SMS Page for procedures.
Laser Guided Bomb CCRP Attack
The Continuously Computed Release Point (CCRP) mode provides computed, automatic release of bombs.
This can be done from a dive, but also from wings-level or a nose-high attitude. The laser guided bomb attack is
identical to unguided bombs with the addition of laser designation with the Targeting Pod (TGP)
This mode requires a target designation point from which to build the bombing solution. Command steering is
provided to the appropriate weapon release point and the weapon will release automatically at the proper time
such that the weapons hit the target.
The bomb laser code must match the TGP laser designator laser code. See the sections on Bomb Seeker
Laser Code and Laser Designator Code for procedures.

The fire control system provides a Steering Line (SL) to provide steering to the designated target. By
placing the Flight Path Marker (FPM) on the SL and holding down the Weapon Release Button, the
weapon will release at the proper time and account for wind.

A Solution Cue is displayed at the top of the SL. It will fall down the line as the range decreases and
the weapons are about to be released.
When the Target Designator (TD) is outside the HUD field on view as shown above, a Target Locator
Line (TLL) extends from the Gun Cross pointing directly at the target. The relative angle is displayed
next to the Gun Cross showing the number of degrees in tens between the cross and the target.
2. Verify TGP is configured for target search and laser fire.
Select A-G mode on the TGP to configure it for target acquisition and weapon guidance. The line of
sight will slave to the current steerpoint when CCRP delivery mode is selected.
The TGP display may be made the sensor of interest (SOI) by positioning the Display Management
Switch (DMS) Down. The current SOI can be identified by the box surrounding the display.

The TGP crosshairs may then be slewed to a new position using the Cursor/Enable Control. Slewing
the Target Designator with the HUD as SOI will also slew the TGP crosshairs.
3. Locate and designate the desired target.
To calculate a bombing solution in CCRP mode, a target first must be designated. This can be done
in two ways:
- Select a Steerpoint that was placed at the target location. The Target Designator box
on the HUD will be placed at the steerpoint. The TGP will slave to that location when CCRP
mode is selected.
- Locate a target with the Targeting Pod. With the TGP SOI, position the TMS Down to
undesignate. The TGP will return to the boresight position near the center of the HUD. Fly
or slew the TGP line of sight to the desired target location. TMS Up to designate. The
Target Designator box on the HUD will be placed at that location.
Updates to the target location may be made by slewing the TD Box in the HUD or slewing the TGP
cursor onto a new position with the Cursor/Enable Control. The Targeting Pod line of sight is used to
calculate the bombing solution regardless of the track mode used.
Command an area track with TMS Up to stabilize the crosshairs over the target. A Point Track may
also be commanded using TMS Up to aid in targeting if desired.

Laser ranging may be performed prior to weapon release to improve the computed firing solution.
See the Laser Ranging section for more information.
The laser designator may be fired with any sensor type selected and from any track mode. The Laser
status is displayed as an L near the bottom of the display when the Laser Arm switch is set to arm.
The laser is fired by squeezing the trigger to the first detent. The L flashes when the laser designator
is firing.
4. Execute a CCRP bombing delivery.
Weapons delivery for laser guided bombs is identical to unguided bomb CCRP delivery.
Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target
even though the target will be out of sight.
The Steering Cue will fall down the Steering Line as the range decreases and the weapon is about to
be released. Time to release counts down at the lower right of the HUD.

fuze to arm or altitude to initiate a pull-up to avoid impacting the ground, whichever is more
immediate. It moves up toward the Flight Path Marker (FPM) as the aircraft loses altitude. Releasing
a bomb with the FPM below the PUAC will not give the bomb time to arm and result in a dud.
5. Press and HOLD the Weapon Release button.
When the Solution Cue begins to move down the Steering Line, about 10 seconds prior to release,
press and hold the Weapon Release button. This provides the fire control computer consent to
release the weapon.
Keep the Flight Path Marker aligned with the Steering Line. This will align your aircraft with the target

JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS (JDAM)
JDAM is an inertial and GPS guidance kit that can be attached to the Mk. 82 or Mk. 84 general-purpose bombs.
When released, the aircraft downloads the target coordinates to the JDAM. The JDAM then guides to those
coordinates. The weapon is completely fire-and-forget but cannot be steered or re-targeted post-launch.

milliseconds. Adding a fuzing delay allows the weapon to penetrate the target prior to exploding.
- GND DLY: Weapon will impact target inert, and then explode after an extended period. Selecting
GND DLY will reveal an additional option labeled FD (fuzing delay). Selectable fuzing delays are
0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after impact.
Impact Angle. Sets the angle that the bomb will attempt to impact the target at (e.g., 60°). A higher impact
angle should be used if tall structures surround the target.
Impact Azimuth. Sets the heading that the bomb will attempt to fly to the target during the terminal phase. A
value of “0” means no specific heading; use a value of “360” if you want the bomb to impact the target from the
south flying north.
Impact Vertical Velocity. Sets the vertical velocity the bomb will attempt to achieve when impacting the target,
in feet per second. A higher vertical velocity creates more effective penetration.

AGM-88 HARM
The AGM-88 High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (HARM) is a supersonic, passive radar-guided air-to-ground
missile intended to strike air defense radar sites and vehicles. The missile has an onboard radar receiver that
homes in on radar energy emitted by ground-based radars, making it fire-and-forget. The pilot can designate
targets using the missile’s onboard radar receiver, or using the separate HARM Targeting System (HTS) pod
(not yet implemented). The HARM may be loaded on stations 3, 4, 6, or 7, but is only flight-certified for stations
3 and 7.
The HARM can be targeted using its onboard radar receiver in one of three modes: position known (POS),
HARM-as-sensor (HAS), or datalink (DL). Currently, DL is not implemented in DCS.
Communication with the HARM missile is managed by the aircraft launcher interface computer (ALIC) onboard
the LAU-118 pylon. The ALIC provides HARM sensor video to the SMS and allows the SMS to hand off threat
types to the AGM-88. The AGM-88 will home in on threats matching the handed-off threat type after launch.

FOV: Displays the missile field of view: “CTR” for center, “LT” for left, “RT” for right, and “WIDE” for wide.
Pressing cycles through FOV settings. The FOV setting controls which portion of the missile’s forward
hemisphere it searches. Pressing the FLCS pinky switch also cycles FOV settings.
Search filter: Pressing this OSB allows the pilot to toggle on and off threats within the current threat table.
Reducing the number of threats that the ALIC is searching for reduces the time for each scan cycle.
HARM UFC: Pressing this OSB displays the HARM page on the DED, where threat tables can be modified.
DTSB: The detected target status box lists detected threat types. When a new threat is detected, its type (e.g.,
“2” for SA-2) is added to the DTSB.
Scan counter: This counter increments after each successive scan made by the AGM-88.
Restart search: Pressing this OSB cancels the current scan cycle and begins a new one.
ALIC video: Detected threats are displayed in this area. Only threats from the active threat table are displayed.
ALIC video is ground stabilized and referenced to missile boresight line. Threats displayed as characters
representing their type (e.g., “2” for SA-2). If the threat is active (radiating), the letter “A” follows the threat type.
If the threat is tracking (guiding an in-flight missile), the letter “T” follows the threat type. If the threat is not
radiating (memory threat), or multiple threats of the same time are co-located, no “A” or “T” is shown.
Pressing TMS forward commands designation of the threat under the TDC. The ALIC video display will switch
to a non-ground-stabilized display of the targeted threat, with crosshairs indicating missile boresight.




Station: Shows which stations have AGM-88s loaded. The station selected for next launch is boxed. A “D” or
“F” is displayed over the station number to indicate a degraded or failed missile.
TDC: The target designator cursor is slewed over a target the pilot wishes to designate, using the cursor control
on the TQS. Pressing TMS forward commands designation of the threat under the TDC, and hands off the
threat type to the AGM-88.
Boresight: Indicates the missile boresight axis.
Scan time: Shows worst-case scan time. The ALIC will repeatedly scan for threats according to the chosen
parameters. Reducing the number of threats to be scanned using the SRCH OBS, or reducing the FOV, will
reduce the scan time and therefore decrease the amount of time before a threat is detected.
Threat types: The five threat types for the current threat table (TBL1, TBL2, or TBL3) are shown along the left
side. If a threat is designated, its type is highlighted. The adjacent OSBs have no function in the HAS sub-
mode.

On the right side is the HARM Launch Scale (HLS), which indicates the range potential of the missile to reach
the current target. The target is assumed to be at the current steerpoint. The SMS estimates both the aircraft
maneuver zone (AMZ), and the missile maneuver zone (MMZ). The AMZ is the zone where the missile can
reach the target if the launching aircraft lofts or turns towards the target first. The MMZ is the zone where the
missile can reach the target by doing entirely its own maneuvering.
FOV box: Indicates the end-game field-of-view of the HARM. The FOV box flashes when the aircraft is within
the missile maneuver zone, target handoff is completed, and the missile is ready to be fired.
HLS: The HARM launch scale (HLS) staple represents the combined AMZ and MMZ; in other words, the
ranges at which the missile can reach the target with or without aircraft maneuvering. The horizontal dash within
the staple indicates the top of the MMZ range and the bottom of the AMZ range. The bottom of the staple
indicates minimum launch distance. The pickle button is only hot when the staple is within the MMZ.
The HLS and all associated symbology are inhibited in HAS mode.
Current range, required loft angle: The position of the caret along the staple represents the current aircraft
range to target along the HLS range scale. If the caret is above the AMZ/MMZ separator, the aircraft must first
maneuver before the missile can reach the target. The number adjacent to the caret is the required loft angle to
place the aircraft within the MMZ. The loft angle is prefixed by an “A” when the aircraft is within the MMZ. The
caret is inhibited when in PB mode and more than 10° off-bearing.
Upper range scale: Will be either 40 or 80 NM, whichever is sufficient to cover the distance to the target.
Zero range: The bottom end of the HLS is a target distance of zero.
Min loft, optimal loft, max loft: The horizontal ticks along the azimuth steering line (ASL) indicate the
minimum and maximum loft required for the missile to reach the target. Maximum loft is the larger tick and
represents the loft angle that will give the missile maximum range. Minimum loft is the smaller tick and
represents the range where the missile would have to do a max-g pulldown to reach the target. In PB mode,
optimal loft is also shown as a pair of whiskers along the ASL. Optimal loft represents the loft angle that gives
the missile the maximum energy available at impact.
Loft cues are inhibited in HAS and POS/RUK modes.
Release altitude: The top number of this datablock is the predicted release altitude assuming the aircraft
makes a 4-g loft to the optimal loft altitude (or the maximum loft altitude if not within the MMZ).
Required turn: The bottom number of this datablock is the required turn to place the aircraft within the MMZ
(e.g., “L03” if a 3° left turn is required). Shows “00” if the aircraft is on-bearing but not yet within the MMZ range.
Once the aircraft is within the MMZ, this field shows the aircraft required turn to face the target (e.g., “L90” if the
aircraft nose is 90° right of the target).
This datablock is not displayed in HAS and POS/RUK modes.
Time to MMZ: Displays the estimated time until the aircraft reaches the MMZ. Displays “0:00” when the aircraft
is inside the MMZ. Not displayed in HAS or POS/RUK modes.
Bearing and distance to target: The bearing and distance (in nautical miles) from the aircraft’s present
position to the target. Not displayed in HAS mode.


HARM DED Page
The HARM DED page is accessed by pressing the LIST button on the UFC, then the 0/M-SEL button to select
MISC, and then the 0/M-SEL button again to select HARM. Note that the HARM option is only displayed when
AGM-88 is the selected on the SMS.
Pressing INC/DEC cycles through the three threat tables (TBL1, TBL2, and TBL3). Each threat table can store
up to five numeric threat IDs. Pressing the dobber switch up or down moves the cursor between slots. Use the
numeric buttons on the UFC to enter a new threat ID. Threat IDs supported in DCS are listed in ALIC Codes.


Preparation
Prior to departure, set up your threat tables as necessary. The threats you expect to fire against must be
present on at least one threat table for the HARM to detect them. Most of the time, you will be able to use one
of the default threat tables:
TBL1 (MODERN SAMS) TBL2 (AAA, SHORAD) TBL3 (OLDER SAMS)
10 (SA-10 FCR) 19 (SA-19 TAR) 3 (SA-3 TR)
BB (SA-20 SR) 15 (SA-15 TELAR) S (SA-3 SR)
CS (SA-10 SR) 8 (SA-8 TELAR) 6 (SA-6 STR)
11 (SA-11 TELAR) A (ZSU-23-4 STR) 2 (SA-2 TR)
SD (SA-11 TAR) DE (DOG EAR MRCC) 13 (SA-13 TELAR)
If your expected threat does not appear on any of these tables, you will need to add it to one of the tables. You
will also improve your ability to efficiently employ HARMs if you consolidate expected threats onto a single
table.
To edit threat tables, first select air-to-ground master mode by pressing the A-G button on the ICP. Then, on the
SMS format, select AG88 as the active weapon type. Display the HARM page on the DED by pressing the LIST
button on the ICP, then the 0/M-SEL button to select MISC, and the 0/M-SEL button again to select HARM.




Use the INC/DEC rocker on the ICP to select a threat table, then use the dobber to place the cursor over a
threat you wish to edit. Use the ICP to enter a new threat number, then press the ENTR button.
Prior to employing HARMs, press the A-G button on the ICP to select air-to-ground master mode. Ensure that
the SMS and WPN formats are visible on an MFD. From the SMS format, power on the HARMs:




Prior to firing a HARM, ensure the MASTER ARM switch is in ARM.
Employment using Position Known (POS) Mode
Summary
1. Select A-G Master Mode [2].
2. Set MASTER ARM switch to ARM.
3. Select AG88 on SMS page (OSB6).
4. Select POS sub-mode on the WPN page (OSB1).
5. Select the attack profile on the WPN page (OSB3).
6. Select the desired threat table and threat on the WPN page (OSB2).
7. Select the target steerpoint.
8. Fly to the AMZ, follow the loft and required turn cues, and wait until the FOV box on the
HUD is flashing.
9. Fire the missile using the weapon release button [RAlt]+[Space].

Position Known (POS) mode is a pre-planned employment mode that relies on a steerpoint being placed at or
near the target radar. The radar type will be downloaded to the ALIC, and the HARM will fly towards the target
steerpoint until the radar is detected, at which point it will home on the radar signal.
In POS mode, the pilot selects one of three attack profiles: Equations of Motion (EOM), Pre-Briefed (PB), or
Range Unknown (RUK). Each of these profiles makes different assumptions about the aircraft maneuver zone
(AMZ) and missile maneuver zone (MMZ). The AMZ is the zone where the missile can reach the target,
assuming the aircraft maneuvers to a required bearing and loft angle first. The MMZ is the zone where the
missile can reach the target without requiring the aircraft to turn or loft.
Equations of Motion (EOM) mode is the most effective profile for off-boresight launches but requires the most
accurate target steerpoint data. To launch with EOM selected, the pilot must first fly to the AMZ, then loft and
launch once within the MMZ. EOM is useful when attacking threats that require high off-boresight (HOBS)
defensive tactics.
Pre-Briefed (PB) mode is the most effective profile at longer ranges but requires an on-bearing attack. To
launch with PB selected, the pilot must first turn the aircraft to point at the target, then fly to the AMZ, then loft
and launch once within the MMZ. PB is most effective at longer ranges but requires the aircraft to fly directly at
the target.
Range Unknown (RUK) mode is the most versatile profile when working with degraded target data. To launch
with RUK selected, the pilot must fly the aircraft into the MMZ, where the missile can make all required
maneuvering to reach the target. RUK is much more tolerant of inaccurate target steerpoints, or when fighting
threats where only bearing information is available.
1. Select POS sub-mode on the WPN page.
Press OSB1 if necessary to change to POS sub-mode. You will see the launch status divider line
 (LSDL) and next-launch information below the LSDL.
1. Select the attack profile.
On the WPN page, press OSB3 until the desired attack profile is shown.
2. Select the threat table and threat.
On the WPN page. press OSB2 until the desired threat table is shown, and then press the OSB
adjacent to the threat you wish to attack from the list on the left side. This will hand off the threat to
the ALIC.
3. Select the target steerpoint.
Activate the steerpoint co-located with the threat you are attacking.
4. Fly to the AMZ, follow the required turn and loft cues, and wait until the FOV box on the HUD
is flashing.
The attack profile you will fly is dependent on whether you have selected EOM, PB, or RUK.
EOM Attacks
In EOM mode, you can launch from any relative bearing, as long as you follow the cues to the MMZ.
First fly towards the target until the HLS range caret indicates that you are within the AMZ. If a
required turn is indicated on the datablock below the HLS, turn as indicated until it reads “00”. (You
do not necessarily need to be facing the target, as long as there is no required turn.) Then, pull up
until the VVI is between the minimum and maximum loft cues on the ASL. When the FOV box is
flashing, you can launch.
PB Attacks
In PB mode, you must be within 10° of bearing to the target. Once your aircraft is pointed towards the
target, fly towards the target until within the AMZ. You will see the minimum, optimal, and maximum
loft cues on the ASL. Pitch the aircraft to place the VVI between the minimum and maximum loft cues.
When the FOV box is flashing, you can launch.
RUK Attacks
In RUK mode, you must fly the aircraft all the way to the MMZ. Follow the azimuth steering line (ASL)
on the HUD towards the target until the FOV box on the HUD is flashing. Once it is flashing, you are
within the MMZ and the weapon release button will be hot. For RUK attacks, the HARM will loft, but
the loft angle will be limited to the maximum the missile can achieve while keeping the threat within its
field of view.
Because range information is degraded or unavailable for RUK attacks, no time-until-intercept or
time-to-impact data is shown on the WPN page, and loft information is suppressed on the HUD.


Employment using HARM-as-Sensor (HAS) Mode
Summary
1. Select A-G Master Mode [2].
2. Set MASTER ARM switch to ARM.
3. Select AG88 on SMS page (OSB6).
4. Select HAS sub-mode on the WPN page (OSB1).
5. Make the WPN page SOI.
6. Select the desired threat table on the WPN page (OSB2).
7. Wait until your threat appears in the ALIC video display on the WPN page.
8. Move the TQS cursor over the threat and designate with TMS forward [RCtrl]+[Up].
9. Fire the missile using the weapon release button [RAlt]+[Space].

HARM-as-sensor (HAS) mode is a target-of-opportunity employment mode using the HARM’s onboard radar
receiver. The HARM detects air defense radar signals and transmits that information to the aircraft. The pilot
can then select a radar to attack and launch a HARM against it. With this mode, distance to the target is not
known, only bearing, so the HARM does not loft, which decreases its effective range.
In HAS mode, the HARM repeatedly scans for threats that match the current active threat table. The HARM
begins with a full scan of its FOV, once for each of the selected threat types. If any targets are found, a detailed
scan is performed to determine the target coordinates. The HARM then steps to the next threat type. In all, this
results in a worst-case scan cycle time of 90 seconds.
The ALIC is in HAS mode when the master mode is A-G, AG88 is the selected weapon on the SMS page, and
“HAS” is displayed as the active sub-mode on the WPN page.
1. Select HAS mode and make WPN page SOI.
Press OSB1 if necessary to change to HAS sub-mode. Ensure that the WPN page is SOI; if not,
press DMS aft to change SOI to the WPN page.




2. Select the appropriate threat table.
Press OSB2 or TMS left until the desired threat table is selected.
3. Reduce the scan time by selecting only the threats you wish to scan for (optional).
If you want to reduce scan time, press SRCH (OSB4), then leave highlighted only the threats you are
interested in searching for.




Press HAS (OSB1) to return to the HAS page.
4. Select an FOV (optional).
You can further reduce scan time by using the pinky switch (or OSB3) to cycle through FOV options
until you find an appropriate FOV.
5. Locate and designate your target.
Point your aircraft (and the missile seeker) in the direction of your expected threat. As each scan
cycle completes, detected threats will be shown in the ALIC video area and placed into the DTSB.
Slew the cursor over the detected threat, then press TMS forward to designate it. The HAS display
will change to indicate the designated threat.




Note that you can designate and fire against any threat that appears on the HAS display, but many
radar operators will cycle their radars on and off or track different targets. This will result in the HARM
being unable to continue tracking the target, and the missile will become ineffective.
To increase probability of kill, you may wish to wait until the threat radar is guiding a missile at you
 (“T” appears next to threat type on HAS display) before firing, since a radar operator is less likely to
cease tracking you while guiding a missile. However, this strategy comes with its own obvious risks!
6. Fire the missile.
Verify the proper threat is highlighted, “RDY” is displayed in the SMS and WPN pages, and the FOV
box in the HUD is flashing, then press and hold the pickle button to fire the missile.
AGM-65 MAVERICK
The AGM-65 Maverick is an optically guided air-to-ground missile intended for the close air support (CAS)
mission. It uses an onboard electro-optical (E/O) or infrared imager that tracks the target, giving it “fire and
forget” capability. The pilot locks the target using the image from the onboard seeker head and fires the missile.
The missile tracks to the target using the image from its seeker head.
The AGM-65 was developed by Hughes Missile Systems Division in 1966 and entered service in 1972.


Operation
The AGM-65 must be warmed up before it can be used. During the warm-up period, onboard image-stabilizing
gyroscopes spin up to operating speed. The missile’s video can be used before the gyroscopes have spun up,
but the image will not be ground stabilized.
Missile video will become available on the WPN page once the gyroscopes are spun up. If you wish to shorten
the warm-up period, pressing the Uncage button while the WPN page is SOI will activate missile video once the
gyroscopes have reached 90% of operating speed.
The pilot can locate and designate targets using the fire control radar (FCR) or heads-up display (HUD), using
the AGM-65’s own seeker head, or the pilot can handoff targets designated from the Sniper Advanced
Targeting Pod (TGP).
When handing off targets from the TGP, the missile boresight correlator (MBC) compares the image from the
targeting pod with the image from the missile seeker head and slews the missile seeker head until the images
match. The MBC is only active when in A/G mode with an AGM-65 selected, and the TGP is sensor of interest
(SOI).
When the Maverick is fired, its onboard imager continues to track the target until the target grows to fill about
75% of the seeker head field of view (FOV). At this point, to continue to impact, the Maverick uses forced
correlation.
The AGM-65 has a ground-configurable fuzing delay and a ground-selectable LAND/SHIP selector that
changes the tracking algorithm to be more suitable for vehicles or ships.

Preparation
The AGM-65 has a duty cycle of one hour in standby, and 30 minutes when active. After powering the
AGM-65s, the missiles will begin their 3-minute warm-up period. Once three minutes has passed, the missiles
are in standby mode and ready for employment. In standby mode, the missiles have one hour of available duty
time. Once a missile’s video is activated, it has 30 minutes of available duty time. When a missile’s duty time
has expired, it must be powered off for two hours.


Automatic Power-On
The SMS can be configured to automatically power on the Mavericks when crossing a configured steerpoint, so
that the pilot does not need to remember to power them on at least three minutes prior to employment.

Summary
1. On the SMS format, select Mavericks.

Employment using VIS mode
The VIS (visual) delivery mode allows you to lock targets that you can see in front of you, by using the HUD to
slew a TD box onto the target. VIS uses DTOS-style sighting. VIS mode is unavailable if the Mavericks are
loaded onto an LAU-88/A rack.

Summary
1. On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE.
2. On the HUD, slew the TD box over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
3. On the WPN format, slew the tracking gate over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
4. Fire the missile [RAlt]+[Space].


1. On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to PRE.
On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to VIS using cursor enable or OSB2. SOI will move to the
HUD, and a TD box will appear, initially caged to the flight path marker (FPM). Confirm that seeker
head video is available on the WPN page.
2. On the HUD, slew the TD box over the target and designate.
Uncage the TD box and slew it over the target using the TQS cursor.
Press TMS forward to designate the target in the TD box. The TD box will ground-stabilize and SOI
will move to the WPN format.




If the wrong target is designated, reject the designation by setting HUD as SOI using DMS forward,
and then undesignate with TMS aft.
3. On the WPN format, slew the tracking gate over the target and designate.
Use TMS left or OSB7 to change video polarity, if desired.
Use the TQS cursor to place the target within the crosshairs on the WPN format, then press TMS
forward to designate the target. The crosshairs will close on the target. Confirm that the missile is
tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the target is in range.
4. Fire the missile.
Fire the missile with the weapon release button.


Employment using BORE mode
BORE (boresight) delivery mode is intended for quick reactive or target-of-opportunity shots. Missiles can be
launched against any target in BORE mode without having to change the SPI. In BORE mode, the Maverick
seeker head is slaved to the pointer cross on the HUD.

Summary
1. On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to BORE.
2. On the HUD, fly the boresight cross over the target and designate [RCtrl]+[Up].
3. Fire the missile [RAlt]+[Space].


1. On the WPN format, set E/O sub-mode to BORE.
On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to BORE using cursor enable or OSB2. SOI will move to
the WPN format. Confirm that seeker head video is available. SOI will move to the WPN page and
missile seeker head position will be displayed on the HUD as a cross. Seeker head position will
initially be boresight.
2. On the HUD, fly the boresight cross over the target and designate.
Fly the pointer cross near your target, then use the TQS cursor to slew the pointer cross over the
target. Reference both the HUD and the WPN format to correctly place the pointer cross, then press
TMS forward to designate.




Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the
target is in range.
3. Fire the missile.
Fire the missile with the weapon release button.
Employment using TGP handoff
The TGP can hand-off targets to the MBC, which will correlate the seeker head video with the TGP video and
attempt to automatically track the TGP target. To improve the likelihood of a successful handoff, perform the
steps listed in Missile Boresighting, above, prior to entering the target area.
You should have the TGP format active on one MFD and the WPN format active on the other.

Summary
1. On the WPN format, set the delivery mode to PRE or VIS using cursor enable [Enter]
or OSB2. Confirm that seeker head video is available.
2. Using the DMS, move SOI to the TGP format [RAlt]+[.].
3. Using the TQS cursor, slew to the target. For a moving target, use TMS forward
 [RCtrl]+[Up] to switch to POINT track. (For more information, see Fehler!
Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden..)

While the TGP is slewed, the MBC will command the seeker head to match slew and automatically attempt a
track. During the attempt, HANDOFF IN PROGRESS will be displayed on the WPN format. The amount of time
to complete correlation is reduced if the missile boresight procedure was completed prior to weapon
employment.
If handoff succeeds, a “C” (correlated) will be displayed over the active pylon number. There is no need to
switch SOI away from the TGP format. Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is
not flashing, and that the target is in range, then press the weapon release button to fire.
If the handoff cannot succeed, “I” (impossible) is displayed above the pylon number instead.


Ripple Fire
Up to two Mavericks can be queued with separate targets for a ripple fire (a.k.a. “quick-draw”) attack. When
more than one Maverick is tracking a target, two 10-mr LOS circles will appear on the HUD, labeled “1” and “2”.
The AGM-65s must be loaded on LAU-117 pylons for ripple fire to be available.

Summary
1. On the SMS format, set RP to 2 (optional).
2. Using one of the delivery modes above, designate a target for the first Maverick
 [RCtrl]+[Up].
3. Press the MSL STEP button [S] to step to the next missile.
4. Designate a target [RCtrl]+[Up] for the second Maverick.
5. Fire both missiles.

1. On the SMS format, set RP to 2 (optional).
Optionally, set the release pulses to two. To do this, from the SMS page, press OSB8 (labeled RP).
Use the MFD to set the releases pulses to 2, then press ENTR (OSB2).
2. Using one of the delivery modes above, designate a target for the first Maverick.
Using one of the delivery modes above, locate and designate a target for the first Maverick. Confirm
that the missile is tracking the correct target. Do not fire the missile.




3. Step to the next missile.
Press the MSL STEP button to step to the next missile.
4. Designate a target for the second Maverick.
Using the same procedure, locate and designate a target for the second missile. Confirm that the
missile is tracking the correct target, the pointer cross is not flashing, and that the target is in range.
On the HUD, LOS circles labeled “1” and “2” will indicate missile LOS and the order the missiles will
fire in.
5. Fire both missiles.
If you set releases pulses to two, press and hold the weapon release button until both missiles have
come off the rail. If not, press and hold the weapon release button once for each missile (twice total).


Force Correlate
The AGM-65G and -H models can be launched in force-correlate mode. This mode does not use the normal
centroid tracking algorithm suitable for targeting vehicles, instead using an image-correlation algorithm suitable
for tracking elements within a picture. Force-correlate mode is useful when launching Mavericks against static
targets such as buildings and structures, when it is desired that the Maverick impact a specific part of that
structure. Instead of tracking the target centroid, the Maverick will strive to impact the exact part of the image
that was targeted (e.g., the base of an antenna).

Summary
1. Using one of the delivery modes above, locate a target.
2. Set the polarity mode to AREA.
3. Designate the image feature you wish to target [RCtrl]+[Up].
4. Fire the missile. [RAlt]+[Space]


1. Using one of the delivery modes above, locate a target.
Select either PRE, VIS, or BORE mode and locate your target.
2. Set the polarity mode to AREA.
Press OSB6, use the cursor enable button, or (if the WPN page is SOI) press TMS right to cycle
between polarity modes until AREA is shown next to OSB6.
3. Designate the image feature you wish to target.
Press DMS aft until the WPN page is SOI.
Using the TQS cursor, slew the targeting gate to the image feature you wish to target, then press
TMS forward to designate it. Confirm that the missile is tracking the correct portion of the image, the
pointer cross is not flashing, and the target is in range.




4. Fire the missile.
Fire the missile with the weapon release button.
VIPS, VRPS, AND PUPS
The F-16 has the capability of displaying visual indicators to assist in making attacks from locations relative to
the target. These indicators can assist the pilot in knowing where the target is relative to a prominent visual
reference, where to commence the attack, and when to begin a pop-up attack. These visual indicators are
programmed using the Data Entry Display (DED) and are displayed on the HUD in pre-planned air-to-ground
sub-modes (e.g., CCRP).
A visual initial point (VIP) is used when the location of the target is not known precisely but is known relative
to a visually prominent object. For example, the target may be known to be five miles northwest of an
identifiable bridge. A visual reference point (VRP) is used when the pilot desires a visual indication of a
location to begin an attack (or otherwise reference relative to a known target position). A pull-up point (PUP) is
a location where a pop-up attack commences.
Note that a single steerpoint cannot have both a VIP and a VRP active.


Using Visual Initial Points
When a visual initial point is specified for a steerpoint, the steerpoint is treated as the initial point, and a target
indication is automatically shown relative to that steerpoint on the HUD. Navigation steering is provided to the
initial point, the idea being that the pilot flies to and visually acquires the initial point, and then performs an INS
update using an overfly or HUD designation. (At this time, INS updates are not implemented.) Once the initial
point location has been updated, the target designation should be directly on top of the actual target position.




Visual Initial Point
 (steerpoint)
Target




In the screenshot above, the location of the target (a factory) is known relative to a radio tower, marked as
steerpoint 1 and depicted as a diamond. The target is shown as a TD box.
To define a VIP, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground CCRP mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “3”, to
show the VIP page. The VIP-TO-TGT page is then shown. Ensure the “VIP-TO-TGT” text is surrounded by the
cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate VIP-TO-TGT. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the VIP line and select the steerpoint located at the visual initial point. Dobber down to each
successive line and enter the bearing from the VIP to the target, then the range from the VIP to the target, and
finally the elevation difference from the VIP to the target. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
On the HUD, a TD box will appear at the target location when in air-to-ground mode and when the VIP
steerpoint is active. Navigation steering will be to the VIP, and the ASL will reference the target.


Using Visual Reference Points
A visual reference point (VRP) is used when a target location is known, and the pilot wishes to mark a reference
point relative to the target. This could be a location to commence the attack from, the location of friendly forces,
etc. With a VRP, the steerpoint is the target point, and the reference point is defined relative to the target
steerpoint. (A VIP works the opposite way; the steerpoint is the reference point, and the target is defined
relative to the reference point).




Target (steerpoint)



Visual Reference
Point




In the screenshot above, steerpoint 2 is over the target (TD box), and a visual reference point (diamond) is
defined relative to it.
To define a VRP, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground CCRP mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “9”, to
show the VRP page. The TGT-TO-VRP page is then shown. Ensure the “TGT-TO-VRP” text is surrounded by
the cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate TGT-TO-VRP. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the TGT line and select the target steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and enter
the bearing from the target to the VRP, then the range from the target to the VRP, and finally the elevation
difference from the target to the VRP. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
On the HUD, a diamond will appear over the VRP when in air-to-ground mode with the target steerpoint
selected. Both navigation and weapon release steering will be to the target, as normal.


Using Pull-Up-Points
A pull-up-point (PUP) is a location where a pop-up attack begins. Pull-up locations are typically precomputed to
allow an aircraft to make a preplanned pop-up attack with sufficient altitude and time to release weapons and
perform a safe-escape maneuver prior to reaching minimum safe altitude. Once these calculations are
completed, the pull-up point configured in the DED the aircraft and displayed on the HUD.




Target (Steerpoint)



Pull-Up Point




In the screenshot above, a pull-up point is defined relative to the target steerpoint. The target is depicted as a
TD box and the pull-up point is shown as a circle. If the pull-up point is outside the HUD FOV, the circle is
clamped to the edge of the HUD and drawn inscribed with an “X”.
To define a pull-up point relative to the target steerpoint, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground mode, then
press LIST on the ICP, then “9”, to show the VRP page. The TGT-TO-VRP page is then shown. Press DCS
Sequence to move to the TGT-TO-PUP page. Ensure the “TGT-TO-PUP” text is surrounded by the cursor, and
press “0” (M-SEL) to activate TGT-TO-PUP. (It will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the TGT line and select the target steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and enter
the bearing from the target to the pull-up point, then the range from the target to the pull-up point, and finally the
elevation difference from the target to the pull-up point. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
If you are using VIP sighting for a target, you can define the pull-up point relative to the VIP rather than the
target. To do this, first ensure that you are in air-to-ground mode, then press LIST on the ICP, then “3”, to show
the VIP page. The VIP-TO-TGT page is then shown. Press DCS Sequence to move to the VIP-TO-PUP page.
Ensure the “VIP-TO-PUP” text is surrounded by the cursor, and press “0” (M-SEL) to activate VIP-TO-PUP. (It
will be displayed in reverse video when active.)
Dobber down to the VIP line and select the visual initial steerpoint. Dobber down to each successive line and
enter the bearing from the VIP to the pull-up point, then the range from the VIP to the pull-up point, and finally
the elevation difference from the VIP to the pull-up point. (To enter a negative number, first press “0” twice.)
DEFENSIVE SYSTEMS
AZIMUTH INDICATOR (RWR)
Detected radars are displayed on the Azimuth Indicator (aka Radar Warning Receiver).
The Azimuth Indicator is a circular-shaped display on the left of the front dash that provides you a visual
representation of radar emitters around your aircraft. The display is in planview with your aircraft in the center.
As threats are displayed around the center of the display, the icons represent the azimuth direction to the threat.
For example: an icon of the left side of the display would indicate an emitter located off your left. In addition to
the icons, an audio system will alert you to the status of the radars detected (search, track, and launch).
The locations of radar emitters on the display do not necessarily correlate to emitter range from your aircraft.
The distance of the threat icon from the center of the display indicates radar signal strength. The closer the icon
is to the center of the display generally indicates the closer the radar is to you. Any time a new emitter symbol is
displayed on the azimuth indicator status change tone is generated by the system. Special tones are also
generated for specific threats or critical threat modes of operation.




A symbol can have three states on the display:
- If a symbol is displayed with no circle around it, it indicates that the radar is in acquisition/search
mode. When a new emitter is detected, a new threat tone will be heard.
- If a symbol has a steady circle around it, it indicates that the radar is tracking/locked on to your
aircraft. When being tracked by an engagement radar, you will be provided a radar lock tone.
- If a symbol has a flashing circle around it, it indicates that the radar is supporting a missile that has
been launched at you. When being launched on by a radar-guided missile, you will hear a missile
launch tone and the LAUNCH light to the left will illuminate.
Indicator lights and buttons are located just to the left of the display.
HANDOFF. Not applicable.
LAUNCH. Illuminates when a missile launch is detected.
MODE. This button toggles between OPEN that can display the 16
highest priority threats or PRI that will only show the five highest threats.
UNKNOWN SHIP. Toggles display of emitter symbols of unknown
weapon systems on and off.
SYS TEST. Initiates the system self-test.
T (TGT SEP). Separates symbols that cover each other on the azimuth
indicator; the symbol with the highest threat priority remains in the right
place.




The Threat Warning Aux panel on the left auxiliary console is used to power the RWR on and off.




SEARCH. Not used.
ACT/PWR. Not used.
ALTITUDE. Not used.
POWER. Toggles RWR system power on and off.
COUNTERMEASURES DISPENSING SET (CMDS)
Selection and release of countermeasures (chaff and flare) is accomplished through a cockpit panel, HOTAS
controls, and a Data Entry Display (DED) page.


CMDS Control Panel
The left auxiliary console is dominated by the countermeasures dispensing system. This system provides
protection against tracking radar, air-to-air and surface-to-air missiles. Protection is provided by ejecting chaff or
flare.




Status Display. The left side displays the status of the CMDS, GO or NO GO. The right side displays
DISPENSE READY when manual consent is required to dispense countermeasures in the SEMI or AUTO
mode.
RWR and JMR Source Switch. These do not control power to the RWR or ECM (Jammer) but rather enable
their data to be used by the CMDS for dispensing in the SEMI or AUTO modes.
MWS Switch. The missile warning system is not applicable to the block 50 f-16C.
JETT Switch. This enables jettisoning of countermeasures when positioned up to JETT. This switch functions
even when the CMDS is turned off.
Quantity Indicators. The quantity remaining of each countermeasures type is displayed. LO is displayed when
the bingo level set on the DED is reached. System failure messages are also displayed in these fields when
applicable.
CH (Chaff) and FL (Flare) Switch. These switches must be enabled to allow dispensing of chaff or flare
countermeasures.
PRGM Knob. This selects one of four pre-set countermeasures programs to be dispensed by HOTAS
command CMS forward.
MODE Knob. This selects the CMS operating mode.
- MAN – The selected manual program may be dispensed by positioning the CMS forward.
- SEMI – The aircraft systems determine the program to be dispensed based on the threat. Consent to
dispense must be given by positioning the CMS aft.
- AUTO – The aircraft systems determine the program to be dispensed based on the threat.
Countermeasures are dispensed automatically. This mode must also be enabled by positioning the
CMS aft. It may be disabled by selecting CMS right.
- BYPASS – This is selected to allow manual dispensing of countermeasures when failures prevent the
other modes from working.


HOTAS
On the stick, there is a four-place switch for countermeasures.




Countermeasures
Management Switch




Center. This is the OFF position and no dispense action is taken.
Forward. This dispenses the manual program selected on the CMDS Panel with the PRGM knob.
Aft. This gives consent to dispense the requested program when the MODE knob is in SEMI. This also enables
the AUTO mode when the MODE knob is in AUTO.
Left. No function.
Right. This disables the AUTO dispense mode.


CMDS DED Pages
The CMDS upfront controls are accessed from the LIST page by pressing 7 on the ICP. Pages may be cycled
through by positioning the DCS switch right to SEQ.
The default bingo quantities for CH (chaff) and FL (flare) are listed on the first page. These quantities may be
changed by placing the CMDS Mode knob in STBY and entering the new bingo quantity in each field.


Chaff Bingo Quantity
Feedback Message
Flare Bingo Quantity
Request Countermeasures Message

Bingo Message



Three voice message options may also be toggled on or off from this page.
Feedback (FDBK). This enables or disables the ‘Chaff Flare’ audio message that plays when a
countermeasures program has been initiated.
Request Countermeasures (REQCTR). This enables or disables the ‘Counter’ audio message that plays when
consent to release countermeasures is requested in the SEMI or AUTO mode.
BINGO. This enables or disables the ‘Low’ or ‘Out’ audio message that plays when the bingo quantity is
reached, or all countermeasures have been expended.
The next DED pages display the number of countermeasures and interval between release for each
countermeasure type. The values may be changed by manually inputting new quantities and intervals. The
CMDS Mode knob should be set to STBY before changing the programs using the DED pages.
The values shown are for the program displayed at the top right of the page. Any of the four programs may be
changed using the Increment/Decrement switch on the ICP to select each in sequence. The pages for chaff and
flare are identical so only the flare page is shown below.


Burst Quantity

Burst Interval Manual Program Selection

Salvo Quantity

Salvo Interval




Burst Quantity. The number of countermeasures released per burst.
Burst Interval. The interval in seconds between countermeasures per burst. This is usually a very small value.
Salvo Quantity. The number of bursts commanded when release consent is given.
Salvo Interval. The time in seconds between each burst.
In the example above, two flares will be released every second for 10 seconds.
