< Admiral Kuznetsov Aircraft Carrier
< The Admiral Kuznetsov is the Russian Navy’s largest warship and its sole aircraft carrier capable of carrying
< horizontal take-off and landing aircraft. Although an aircraft carrier at first glance, it is technically designated an
< ‘aircraft-carrying cruiser’, due to its formidable long-range anti-ship cruise missile capability. This designation
< allows it to pass in and out of the Black Sea while conforming to the 1936 Montreux Convention, an
< international agreement that does not allow aircraft carriers heavier than 15,000 tons to pass through the
< Turkish Straits.
< 
< 
< 
< 
< The Admiral Kuznetsov differs greatly from US aircraft carrier designs in that it does not feature catapults for
< launching aircraft. Instead, it features a ‘ski-jump’, or upward curved ramp, that converts some of the aircraft’s
< forward momentum into a positive rate of climb. This, along with wind over the deck from the carrier’s speed,
< greatly reduces the required takeoff roll for aircraft.
< Three starting positions are available for fighter aircraft. Positions 1 and 2 are located near the bow of the ship
< and provide a 90-meter takeoff run. Position 3 is located farther aft and provides a takeoff run of 180 meters,
< twice that of the other two. This third location should be selected for aircraft with heavier fuel or weapons
< loadouts that require a longer takeoff run.

< 
< Parking

< 
< Elevator Elevator
< Each starting position features a jet blast deflector that serves the same function as on the Nimitz class carrier.
< There are also two holdback devices, or ‘stoppers’, that extend upwards, forward of the main wheels. These
< hold the aircraft in place until after the aircraft’s engines are run up before launch.

< The Luna-3 Optical Landing System works in a manner similar to the Nimitz class’s IFLOLS system. A green
< light indicator will be visible when on glideslope for landing. A yellow light will be visible when above glideslope
< and red light will be visible when below glideslope.
< Aircraft also land on an angled deck in a comparable way to those on the Nimitz class carrier. Four arresting
< wires of the Svetlana-2 system are strung across the deck at a spacing of 12 meters. The aircraft’s tailhook
< catches a wire and brings it to a stop.

< Offensive Weapons
< The Admiral Kuznetsov is equipped with SS-N-19 'Shipwreck' (P-700 Granit) anti-ship missiles, fired from 12
< vertical launch tubes on the forward flight deck. A small solid rocket fires them clear of the launcher. Flight is
< sustained by a turbojet propulsion system, accelerating the missile to a top speed of mach 2.5 at high altitude or
< mach 1.2 at its normal low altitude. The maximum range is approximately 300 nm (550 km).
< The missiles rely on their own inertial navigation system to approach the target then switch to active radar
< homing for the terminal guidance phase. A 1,650 lb (750 kg) conventional warhead is fitted for use against
< ships.
< 
< 
< 
< 
< Engagements with these missiles are limited to a 90-degree arc in front of the firing vessel. The carrier must be
