< When an aircraft lands, it requests a taxi route to exit the landing area. Deck control will search for an open
< parking location by priority order listed below and provide a taxi route to it. First, it determines a free location
< based on the maximum number of open parking locations. For example, if the parking spot aft of the island is
< occupied, the next parking spot in priority order will be selected. Next, deck control will check that the chosen
< parking location is suitable for the landing aircraft type and that there are no taxi route obstructions like other

< GLOSSARY
< Air Boss: Officer in charge of all flight deck and tower operations within 5 nautical miles of the ship. Located in
< Pri-Fly.
< Angels: Altitude in thousands of feet. For example, Angels 3 = 3,000 feet.
< Axial Winds: Winds down the longitudinal axis of the ship created by the ship’s forward movement. This
< causes a right-to-left crosswind across the angled deck.
< Ball: Light projected by source lens on the IFLOLS. Also referred to as “Meatball.”
< Bingo Fuel: Aircraft fuel state in sufficient quantity necessary to fly to the bingo airfield or carrier with X lbs.
< remaining, depending on aircraft type.
< Bolter: A touchdown on the carrier in which the arresting hook does not engage the arresting wires.
< BRC: Base recovery course, which is the ship’s magnetic course.
< Buster: Proceed at maximum airspeed.
< Carrier Air Traffic Control Center (CATCC): The centralized department responsible for the status-keeping of
< all carrier air operations and control of all airborne aircraft involved in launch and recovery.
< Carrier Control Zone (CCZ): The airspace within a circular limit defined by a 5 mile radius around the ship
< surface up to and including 2,500 feet under the control of the Air Boss during visual; flight rules conditions.
< Case I: Refers to departure/recovery procedures and landing patterns conducted in visual conditions when
< greater than 3,000-foot ceiling and 5 nautical mile visibility exists within the carrier control zone. Case I
< recoveries will marshal overhead the ship and enter the pattern via the break.
< Case II: Case II recovery occurs during daylight hours when conditions may be poor on the approach but
< adequate for landing under visual flight rules. The cloud ceiling must be above 1,000 feet and visibility more
< than 5 nm. Case II recovery is a controlled descent to the break and the pattern. It is used when a visual
< penetration cannot be made. The approach may be via radar vectors or a TACAN or ADF approach. In no case
< will more than a section of two aircraft execute a Case II recovery. Case II departure is a procedure used to
< climb through instrument conditions to visual conditions.
< Case III: Used for weather less than 1,000/5, or at night.
< CCA: Carrier-controlled approach.
< Charlie: Refers to the time the first aircraft is expected at the ramp. A “Charlie” call is a directive to enter the
< landing pattern.
< Chicks: Wingmen in a flight.
< Clara: Meatball is not in sight.
< Clearing Turn: Associated with a Case I or II departure. Immediately after launch, aircraft from bow cats initiate
< a right turn then a turn to parallel the BRC. Aircraft launched from the waist cats initiate a left turn then a turn to
< parallel the BRC. The purpose of these turns is to provide aircraft lateral separation on multiple launches from
< the carrier.
< Cross-Deck Pendant (CDP): Arresting gear wire
< Cut Lights: Green lights mounted horizontally and centered above the IFLOLS lens box and are controlled by
< the LSO. Utilized during Zip Lip and EMCON conditions instead of UHF to give pilots clearance to land, i.e.,
< “Roger Ball.” Subsequent cut lights mean “power.” Also, used in conjunction with waveoff lights to signal bingo.
< Datum Lights: Green reference lights mounted horizontally on the IFLOLS, seen on each side of the centered
< cell.
< Departure Reference Radial (DRR): Preassigned radial usually passed during the brief or as standard
< operating procedure.
< Emission Control Procedures (EMCON): Electronic emission control procedures are in effect at the ship to
< avoid detection. All radio, radar, and navigation equipment transmissions are eliminated except as required for
< safety of flight.
< Expected Approach Time (EAT): The future time at which an aircraft is cleared to depart inbound or penetrate
< from a pre-assigned fix. Aircraft depart and commence approach at assigned time if no further instructions are
< received.
< Father: Code name for the ship’s TACAN.
< Feet Wet or Feet Dry: Aircraft crossing the coastline enroute to or returning from the ship.
< Final Bearing (FB): The magnetic bearing assigned by CATCC for final approach (an extension of the landing
< area centerline); usually BRC minus the landing area angle of 10°.
< Foul Deck: Landing area is not free of all obstructions or the flight deck is not ready to recover aircraft.
< Foul Line: A line painted on both sides of the landing area to define the minimum area that must be free of
< obstructions in order to consider the deck clear.
< Hangar Deck: Area below the flight deck used to store and repair aircraft.
< Holdback: Metal fitting designed to break or release at a preset level of force during a catapult stroke.
< Hook to Eye: The vertical distance measured between the pilot’s eye and the aircraft’s hook.
< Hook to Ramp: The clearance distance between the aircraft’s hook point and the flight deck as it crosses the
< ramp.
< Improved Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS): Pilot’s landing aid, i.e., meatball.
< Interval: The time between you and the aircraft you are to follow.
< In the Middle Position: A distance on the groove that is between the “start” and the “in close” position. The
< middle-third of the groove.
< Jet Blast Deflector (JBD): Hydraulically lifted deck plate mounted behind each catapult.
< Landing Signals Officer (LSO). Controls all fixed-wing aircraft on final approach, or ‘in the groove’ during
< carrier landings.
< Launch Bar: Metal arm attached to the nose gear and used to launch the aircraft.
< Mark your Father: State bearing and distance from ship.
< Marshal: Holding pattern during Case I, II, and III recoveries. Also the term used for the ship’s radar controller.
< Mother: Code name used to signify the carrier.
< Overhead Time: The scheduled time a flight of aircraft is expected overhead the ship for pattern entry.
< Paddles: The call sign for the LSO.
< Pilot Landing Assistance Television (PLAT): Video camera system used to record carrier operations.
< Plane Guard: SAR helicopter or ship assigned during aircraft launch and recovery, usually located in starboard
< Delta for a helicopter, three miles astern for a ship.
< Platform: A reporting point in the ship’s TACAN approach (normally at 20 NM from the ship at 5,000 feet) at
< which the rate of descent is decreased to 2,000 feet per minute.
< Popeye: Code word used to signify that aircraft is operating on instruments in poor weather or low visibility.
< Pri-Fly: Tower location where the Air Boss oversees the pattern and flight deck operations.
< Pull Back: Action following arrestment whereby the wire is partially retracted to allow the pilot to raise the
< tailhook.
< Push Back: Action taken anytime the aircraft needs to be moved back by deck personnel.
< Ramp: The aft end of the flight deck.
< Roger Ball: The call made by the LSO that indicates you are cleared to land and the LSO has positive control
< (call made less than a mile prior to landing).
< Roll Angle: Movement of the lens about the roll axis (set for each type of aircraft) to maintain a constant
< targeted hook touchdown point.
< RTB: Signal to return to base.
< See You: Communication used to indicate that flight lead has the ship in sight.
< Shuttle: The portion of the catapult that attaches to the launch bar during catapult launches.
< Starboard Delta: Holding pattern used by the helicopters and COD aircraft flown on the starboard side of the
< ship and using right-hand turns at 500 feet.
< Start: The first-third of the groove length.
< Suspend: Stop the catapult launch sequence.
< Sweet Lock: Positive TACAN lock-on.
< Tension: The portion of the catapult launch sequence when the shuttle is hydraulically moved forward to
< remove slack.
< Tiedown: Chocks and chains used to secure aircraft on the flight deck.
< Zip Lip: Condition in which radio communications are minimized.
